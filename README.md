## Overview
SSARE (Scalable Article Retrieval Engine) is an advanced, open-source information architecture designed to autonomously aggregate, process, and store news articles. With a focus on political discourse, SSARE aligns with the upcycling philosophy of data, enabling efficient, on-demand retrieval of pertinent information.

## Contribution: Article Input Scripts
We are actively seeking contributions from data scientists and coders, particularly in the realm of article input scripts. By writing scripts that scrape, process, and standardize news articles, you can help us expand our database and improve the breadth of our political news coverage.

### Why Contribute?
- Impactful Work: Your contributions directly support the development of an open and diverse political news repository.
- Skill Development: Enhance your coding and data processing skills by working on a real-world, scalable data project.
- Community Recognition: Get acknowledged for your contributions within our growing community of developers and data enthusiasts.

### How to Contribute
1. Familiarize with SSARE: Understand our architecture and the format we use for news articles.
2. Write an Input Script: Develop a script that scrapes news articles from a source and formats them into our standardized schema: ["url", "headline", "paragraphs", "source"].
3. Test Your Script: Ensure your script accurately scrapes and formats the data.
4. Submit Your Script: Create a pull request with your script and a brief explanation of the news source and how your script works.

### Contribution Guidelines
- Code Quality: Write clean, well-documented, and efficient code.
