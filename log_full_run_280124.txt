Rashida Tlaib pressed undecided voters in Michigan to throw their support behind Joe Biden.\n  \n\n      In a virtual rally alongside other lawmakers, the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress was clear in her enthusiasm for Biden, arguing that he would create a better future for Americans.\n  \n\n      “This election … has to be a huge turnout, one that for me has to speak volumes. People say your vote is your voice; well, I want the voice to be a bullhorn,” she said, adding, “I want it to be so loud and so echoey that people understand exactly what we all believe in, which is, we believe that government must be about people.”\n  \n\n      More than three years later, the silence from Tlaib and other Muslim leaders on the president’s 2024 reelection bid is speaking volumes as Biden continues to back Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza.\n  \n\n      Tlaib – a liberal firebrand who represents parts of Detroit and its suburbs – accused the president in November of supporting a Palestinian “genocide,” straining her relationship with Biden. Her office declined multiple requests for comment on whether she would support the president in his reelection bid.\n  \n\n      The distance between Tlaib and the White House is reflective of the work Biden must do to repair the relationship with a key part of his coalition.\xa0Many Arab Americans and Muslim voters who have spoken to CNN say they will not support Biden’s reelection efforts due to his unwavering support of Israel and failure to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. But the problems go beyond that\xa0– Democratic strategists who spoke to CNN are warning that the president may struggle to find surrogates willing to take on the task of speaking to key voter groups such as Muslims, Arab Americans and angered progressives.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Burns, nominee for Central Intelligence Agency director, testifies during his Senate Select Intelligence Committee confirmation hearing, Wednesday, Feb. 24, 2021, on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n\nTom Williams/Pool/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nEfforts to secure hostage deal and pause in Gaza fighting step up as Biden dispatches CIA chief for crucial talks in Europe\n\n\n\n\n      The\xa0administration appears to be struggling with finding Arab American and Muslim leaders who are willing to even meet with White House officials, and\xa0no Muslim or Arab American groups have endorsed Biden’s reelection bid.\n  \n\n      But multiple local leaders declined invitations to meet with Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden’s campaign manager. Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, the city’s first Arab American and Muslim mayor who represents one of the country’s largest Muslim populations,\xa0told CNN Friday that he declined the meeting because “this is not a time for electoral politics” and that a conversation about change would be “with policymakers. Not campaign staff.”\n  \n\n      “If President Biden would\xa0want to come and have a real\xa0conversation about how he\xa0changes course, about his\xa0actions, decisions that he’s\xa0made overseas upon calling for\xa0an immediate ceasefire, we can\xa0entertain such a conversation and sit down,” Hammoud told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source.”\n  \n\n      In a previous interview with CNN, Hammoud said he would be willing to meet with the president if there was a\xa0“an opportunity to have a real constructive dialogue about how we move forward.”\n  \n\n      “But if it’s just an opportunity to take pictures and to say that ‘we listened,’ but nothing is changing, then it’s not a table worth sitting at,” he told CNN.\n  \n\n      A\xa0White House spokesperson told CNN its officials have\xa0“had more than 100 conversations with leaders at the local and state level concerning the conflict and humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza.”\n  \n\n      In addition, the spokesperson added that the\xa0White House offices of Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Engagement have consistently engaged with community leaders and elected officials since the October 7 attacks.\n  \n\n      Recently, a staffer in Vice President Kamala Harris’ office reached out to a prominent figure within the Arab American community in Michigan to see whether they would meet with Harris as the vice president wanted to speak with community leaders, according to a person familiar with these conversations.\n  \n\n      The individual declined the request, stating the administration has continued to “ignore” Arab Americans following the October 7 attack, the person said.\xa0Harris’ office said in a statement to CNN that\xa0“the President and Vice President have made it a priority to hear directly from Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim communities of America on the conflict in Gaza.”\n  \n\n      “(Harris) has also spoken to Hanan Shaheen, the mother of Wadee Alfayoumi, the 6-year-old Palestinian-American who was killed in October in Illinois. The President and Vice President will continue to listen and engage directly with these communities,” the statement said.\n  \n\n    Discord becoming all too apparent\n\n\n      Biden has not been able to ignore the discord within his own party as he attempts to turn the page to a general election campaign, as cries of “Genocide Joe” and “ceasefire now” follow him around the campaign trail.\n  \n\n      Democratic strategist Adrian Hemond said the president should be concerned about the lack of support he is getting among these communities, particularly in Michigan, which is home to more than 200,000 Muslim American voters.\n  \n\n      “He’s got a little bit of a political tightrope to walk right now,” said Hemond, who is based in Michigan. “A lot of them are going to respond by staying home because they think both their options are bad. And I think that’s a pretty good descriptor of Arab American voters right now.”\n  \n\n      The ceasefire calls are coming from a diversity of progressive groups, including those representing Jewish voters, voters of color and young people – key parts of Biden’s winning 2020 coalition.\n  \n\n      Chavez Rodriguez’s Michigan meetings, the source familiar said, are part of a routine dialogue with constituency groups and “have been in the works for several weeks” as the Biden campaign looks to engage with grassroots leaders.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS President Joe Biden at the United Auto Workers (UAW) conference in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Jan. 24, 2024.

The campaign reached out again this week and asked whether he’d help organize a meeting with members of the community and Chavez Rodriguez for Friday.\n  \n\n      He was working toward assembling a meeting of 10 to 15 members of the Arab American and Muslim community, including some local elected officials, for Friday afternoon, but they ultimately decided not to move forward.\n  \n\n      “I gauged the pulse of the community, and the war in Gaza’s been going on for 111 days. There’s 30,000 dead people. Fifty percent of the population is living in hunger. There’s no functioning hospitals and ultimately there’s been 111 days to able to call for a ceasefire,” he said. “At the end of the day, people look at us as leaders, and we’ve got to make a leadership decision and we’ve got to do what’s in the best interest of our community.”\n  \n\n      Osama Siblani, a Dearborn community leader and publisher of the Arab American News, was among those who did meet with Chavez Rodriguez on Friday morning, calling the 90-minute conversation “direct and frank.”\n  \n\n      “I looked her in the eyes and told her how I and my community feel about Biden,” said Siblani, who is Lebanese American.\n  \n\n    Potential backers stay silent\n\n\n      The White House has tried to quell criticism of the president’s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict by holding listening sessions for groups from inside and outside of the government. It also deployed Dilawar Syed – the deputy administrator of the US Small Business Administration who is one of the highest-ranking Muslim officials in the Biden administration – to a vigil for the\xa06-year-old Palestinian American boy, stabbed to death because he was Muslim.\n  \n\n      But those efforts have failed to quell frustrations among sections of Biden’s 2020 coalition.\n  \n\n      “To discount the anger from Arab voters, Muslim voters and voters of color across the country who also overwhelmingly support a ceasefire is discounting core parts of (Biden’s) base and the core base of the Democratic Party that has – election after election – elected Democrats and served as the reason Democrats beat Republicans in every campaign cycle that they do,” said Usamah Andrabi, the communications director for Justice Democrats, a progressive grassroots organization.\n  \n\n      In the last presidential election cycle, Biden received the support of several prominent Muslim American elected officials and community leaders. But this time around, many are skeptical – and angry.\n  \n\n      “I believe he is beyond redemption,” said Khalid Turaani, 57, a consultant based in Michigan and co-chair of the state’s chapter of the Abandon Biden movement. “I will not vote for Joe Biden. I believe that his complicity and his active participation in the genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza disqualify him from my vote.”\n  \n\n      “I just feel very, very angry that I voted for such a person that would enable such atrocities,” said Farah Khan, an IT specialist in Northville, Michigan.\n  \n\n      At least 146,620 of the 200,000 Muslim American voters in Michigan cast a ballot in the 2020 election cycle, according to an analysis by Emgage. In 2020, Biden won Michigan by three percentage points over Trump. Four years prior, Trump won the state over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton by 0.2 percentage points.\n  \n\n      Muslim leaders within the Abandon Biden movement, a national campaign working against Biden’s reelection efforts, say they operate in crucial swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota, Florida, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania to get voters not to support Biden.\n  \n\n      Nabila Taha, a Pennsylvania resident who spoke at an Abandon Biden news conference in Washington, DC, this month, said she would do everything possible to ensure Biden will not win in 2024.\n  \n\n      “We will go knocking on every door … telling them the story of the billions that they are sending over to kill our brothers and sisters instead of spending it here on our schools, while our senior citizens are fighting to choose between eating or paying for medications,” Taha said.\n  \n\n    Abandoning the president\n\n\n      The Abandon Biden campaign was created in Minnesota after a group of Muslim Americans demanded the president call for a ceasefire by October 31. And when Biden didn’t respond to these calls to support a permanent halt in fighting, the group vowed to campaign against him.\n  \n\n      When a reporter asked Biden whether he were concerned about Arab American voters who said they would not support him, he responded, “The former president wants to put a ban on Arabs coming into the country. … We understand who cares about the Arab population.”\n  \n\n      Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign’s communications director, told reporters on Wednesday that the president will “continue to engage in conversations with the Arab American community.”\n  \n\n      “We believe that it’s important to have consistent conversations with folks, even when they disagree with you on a policy position,” he said.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks to United Auto Workers members at the UAW's Community Action Program legislative conference in Washington, DC, on January 24.\n\nLeah Millis/Reuters\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nBiden’s campaign headaches on display in repeat public interruptions\n\n\n\n\n      But it is still unclear whether Biden or Harris plans to visit Michigan or other states to engage with Arab American and Muslim voters specifically. Some Arab American and Muslim voters say even if Biden’s campaign ramps up their outreach, it will be too late.\n  \n\n      “I feel used as a Muslim voter,” said Ariana Afshar, 27, a content creator based in California. “He used people like myself in order to get elected and is now doing whatever serves him in his position.”\n  \n\n      “Outreach will not work here,” said Hassan Abdel Salam, a human rights professor at the University of Minnesota and co-founder of the Abandon Biden campaign. “When you conduct this type of campaign of death, and it lasts over 100 days, there is no way that any outreach can reverse the decisions they’ve done.”\n  \n\n      “There is no possibility of repair while he is supporting an act of genocide. So, there is no reason to have communication,” said Dawud Walid, the executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n  \n\n      Some Michigan voters told CNN that they would rather support a third-party candidate or Trump if it means Biden will lose in 2024.\n  \n\n      “If it’s neck and neck, and in order to get Biden to lose it will require me to vote for Trump, then absolutely I will do that. I will do exactly that,” said Samraa Luqman, 41, a real estate agent who did not vote for Biden or Trump in the last presidential election cycle.\n  \n\n      She added: “I never in my life thought I would say that. … They have really screwed up this time.”\n  \n\n      CNN’s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report.", 'source': 'cnn'}

For everyone who is demanding tougher border control, this is the way to do it. If you’re serious about the border crisis, pass a bipartisan bill and I will sign it.”\n  \n\n      Biden took office pledging to restore asylum and manage the border in a “humane” way.\xa0But his administration has faced the harsh realities and challenges at the US-Mexico border amid record migration across the Western Hemisphere — making it a political vulnerability seized on by Republicans.\n  \n\n      In recent weeks, Trump has lobbied Republicans to oppose the border compromise being delicately hashed out in the Senate because he wants to campaign on the issue this November.\n  \n\n      Over the course of his administration, Biden has leaned on more restrictive measures to try to stem the flow of migration, but Friday’s statement revealed a tougher stance as the president tries to control an issue that’s dogged him, while risking putting him at odds with some allies.\n  \n\n      “(The compromise) would give me, as President, a new emergency authority to shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed. And if given that authority, I would use it the day I sign the bill into law,” Biden’s statement said.\n  \n\n      Biden’s embrace of an authority that would allow him to shut down the border in the event of a migrant surge was striking to current and former administration officials, as well as to immigrant advocates.\n  \n\n      Johnson on Saturday attacked Biden over his endorsement of the potential border deal, arguing the president can take executive action without Congress to clamp down on migrant crossings.\n  \n\n      And in his first statement on the Senate deal, Johnson claimed that it would force the US to surrender to illegal migration. “According to reports, the Senate’s pending proposal would expressly allow as many as 150,000 illegal crossings each month (1.8 million per year) before any new ‘shutdown’ authority could be used. At that point, America will have already been surrendered,” Johnson said in the statement.\n  \n\n      A source familiar with the Senate deal, however, said Johnson is providing a false interpretation of the proposal. The source said that once border crossings reach a level requiring the Department of Homeland Security to take emergency measures, federal authorities would be required to significantly restrict illegal border crossings until the US sees fewer than 2,000 migrants approach the border per day over a two-week span.\n  \n\n      Under the soon-to-be-released package, the Department of Homeland Security would be granted new emergency authority to shut down the border if daily average migrants crossing unlawfully reach\xa04,000 over a one-week span. Certain migrants would be allowed to stay if they proved to be fleeing torture or persecution in their countries.\n  \n\n      The details remain unclear. But the authority is reminiscent of a Covid-era border restriction invoked by Trump in 2020 that allowed authorities to turn migrants away at the border. It resulted in more repeat border crossers and still placed a strain on the immigration system.\xa0\n\n\n      Current and former Homeland Security officials have raised alarm over the deal, casting doubt over the effectiveness of the authority to shut down the border.\n  \n\n      It’s impossible to close the border to asylum seekers because of current law, despite multiple attempts by Trump to do so while he was in office.\n  \n\n      One former Biden official said Biden’s Friday statement “made sense politically to put down a marker now that Johnson said no.”\n  \n\n      Officials are concerned that the new emergency authority would come with the same headaches that accompanied Title 42, a Covid-era restriction.\n  \n\n      Title 42, a public health authority invoked by Trump during the pandemic, allowed authorities to turn migrants encountered at the US-Mexico border back to Mexico or their origin country.\n  \n\n      But authorities still contended with a high number of border crossings, and thousands of people gathered in northern Mexico waiting to cross.\n  \n\n      While Title 42 was in place, officials also grappled with a jump in repeat crossers because there was little in the way of legal consequences or buy-in from Mexico, where thousands of migrants were pushed back.\n  \n\n      Immigrant advocates quickly slammed Biden over his statement — revealing the deepening rift between the president and the advocacy community.\n  \n\n      For weeks, immigrant advocates and progressives fretted about the parameters of a border deal that includes punitive measures for migrants crossing the US-Mexico border, including those seeking asylum, and raised alarm over White House concessions in the ongoing talks.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMigrants take part in a caravan toward the border with the United States in Chiapas State, Mexico, on January 8, 2024.\n\nStringer/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n      Robyn Barnard, senior director of refugee advocacy for Human Rights First, called the situation disappointing.\n  \n\n      “This president is laying bare his callous disregard for and willingness to play politics with the lives of Black and brown migrants, many of whom come to our Southern border in order to exercise their legal right to seek asylum,” Barnard said.\n  \n\n      “If he listened to any of the immigration experts in his administration, he would know that these proposals — shutting down the border, expelling migrants, making it harder to access asylum protection — are not ‘fair’ and will not ‘secure the border,’ they will however cause chaos and human suffering,” she added.\n  \n\n      Kerri Talbot, executive director at Immigration Hub, decried the politicization of the border.\n  \n\n      “I hope that the leaders of both parties can step back and think through real solutions that would lead to a controlled border,” she told CNN. “Shutting down the border has never been possible. What is possible is a well-resourced secure and humane border if Congress would pass the necessary funds.”\n  \n\n      Earlier in the week,\xa0Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California warned of progressive backlash against the administration over the potential immigration deal.\n  \n\n      “There’s the substance and there’s the process. The frustration about the process is, frankly, the lack of transparency. It’s been months now and there’s still no language, no text floating around to be able to review and say, ‘I agree with this’ or ‘I don’t agree with that,’” Padilla told CNN’s Manu Raju.\n  \n\n      “Returning to Trump’s playbook, you know, Trump’s greatest hits when it comes to border security is not the answer to the problem.”\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with new reporting.\n\n\n      CNN’s Manu Raju contributed to this report.', 'source': 'cnn'}

The State Department also sent Congress a formal notification of its intent to sell $8.6 billion worth of F-35s to Greece. Congress is expected to approve both sales.\n  \n\n      Secretary of State Antony Blinken was extensively engaged for months with Turkish officials and US lawmakers to reach the deal to stop Erdogan’s obstruction of Sweden’s NATO bid that would see Turkey receive the fighter jets – one of its top requests of the US.\n  \n\n      When Sweden, along with Finland, first applied to join the defensive alliance in May 2022, Turkey sought to pull the US directly into the negotiations – a move the US rebuffed, according to a US official. However, the administration was cognizant the US had a key point of leverage – the F-16s – if that became necessary.\n  \n\n      Once Turkey approved Finland’s accession in March 2023, Blinken worked intensely behind the scenes to try to get Sweden’s approval done by last summer’s NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania.\n  \n\n      During a trip to Turkey in February 2023, Blinken met with Erdogan, who stressed the need for the US to give Turkey the F-16s before he would approve Sweden’s membership into the alliance. Blinken, in turn, told the Turkish president multiple times that members of Congress would not approve the sale of jets until Turkey allowed Sweden to join NATO.\n  \n\n      It was at this point, the US official said, that the administration decided to leverage the jets more directly. The process moved forward more quickly with the appointment of\xa0Hakan\xa0Fidan\xa0as Turkey’s foreign minister.\xa0Fidan\xa0was seen as having a closer relationship to Erdogan than his predecessor. Blinken and\xa0Fidan\xa0met on the margins of a conference in London in late June 2023 to hash out details of a potential deal.\n  \n\n      Following that meeting, Blinken discussed the matter with then-Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Robert Menendez – who had long opposed the sale of the jets to Turkey – and other members of Congress. The New Jersey senator and others made clear that they wanted to ensure Greece’s support. Blinken engaged extensively with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos\xa0Mitsotakis\xa0to discuss what Greece would need to feel comfortable with neighboring Turkey receiving the jets. Turkey and Greece have an incredibly tense relationship.\n  \n\n      After those initial months of negotiations, the first hurdle was cleared at Vilnius, when Erdogan publicly committed to move forward on Sweden’s accession.\n  \n\n      The intensive effort shifted to ensuring that the Turkish parliament would vote in favor of accession. As the US worked to solidify the deal, Blinken and\xa0Fidan\xa0spoke weekly over the autumn and winter, the US official said. The top US diplomat spoke with Greek Prime Minister half a dozen times. He spoke extensively with Menendez and his successor, Sen. Ben Cardin, and the leadership of the House Foreign Affairs Committee to try to assuage their concerns about the F-16 sale.\n  \n\n      The Turkish Parliament finally voted in favor of Sweden’s NATO accession Tuesday, and Erdogan signed off on the instruments of ratification Thursday.\n  \n\n      The documents were then sent from Turkey to the US to be physically deposited in a vault at the State Department, which serves as the treaty depositary for NATO, on Friday.\n  \n\n      This was the final step needed before the agency sent the formal notifications about the F-16 sales to Congress.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free\xa0here.\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \xa0—\xa0\n    \n\n\n      Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said this week he will continue to defend his state’s border despite a 5-4 Supreme Court order that the US Border Patrol can take down razor wire Texas set up along portions of the US border with Mexico.\n  \n\n      Questioning the court’s action, the Republican governor criticized its lack of clarity when it sided with the Biden administration, which wants to remove the razor wire while a legal challenge to Abbott’s actions plays out.\n  \n\n      “There were no sentences, or paragraphs or pages of an opinion written by the Supreme Court, so no one knows at all what they were thinking – all we know is that they wanted to send it back to the 5th\xa0Circuit,” Abbott said on Fox News, arguing, “There was no opinion about anything – about razor wire, what Texas is doing or anything like that.”\n  \n\n      The razor wire issue is playing out as part of a larger standoff in which Abbott argues by not acting more forcefully at the border, the federal government has violated its responsibility to protect the state from “invasion.”\n  \n\n      Is this a governor essentially ignoring the Supreme Court? Why is the federal government in charge of border policy in the first place? I went to CNN’s Supreme Court analyst Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, with those questions. Our conversation, conducted by email, is below.\n  \n\n    Abbott is not ignoring the Supreme Court\n\n\nWOLF: How does Abbott justify essentially ignoring the Supreme Court?\n\n\nVLADECK: It’s really important to stress that two different things are true: First, Abbott is\xa0not\xa0“essentially ignoring” the Supreme Court. Second, he\xa0is\xa0interfering with federal authority to a degree we haven’t seen from state officials since the desegregation cases of the 1950s and 1960s.\n  \n\n      With regard to the court, all that the justices did on Monday was to vacate a lower-court injunction, which had itself prohibited federal officials from cutting or otherwise removing razor wire that Texas officials have placed along or near the US-Mexico border.\n  \n\n      Nothing in Monday’s unexplained order stops Abbott from doing anything; it just means the\xa0federal government\xa0can’t be sanctioned by courts if it takes steps to remove those obstacles.\n  \n\n      Instead, the real issue here is that Abbott is deliberately impeding the ability of federal officials to act in and around Eagle Pass – in a way that isn’t in outright defiance of the Supreme Court (yet), but that\xa0is\xa0inconsistent with the supremacy of federal law.\n  \n\n      That’s why Abbott is trying to invoke a claim that the federal Constitution itself authorizes what he’s doing, because if the Constitution doesn’t empower him to take these steps, then “preemption” (the idea that federal statutes and federal policies promulgated pursuant to those statutes override contrary state laws and policies) should be the whole ballgame here.\n  \n\n    Abbott misuses the Constitution to declare an ‘invasion’\n\n\nWOLF: Abbott has tried to justify his actions at the border by declaring an “invasion” in Texas. That language has been used for political reasons by Republican lawmakers. But it also has legal importance in the Constitution. Is the Supreme Court likely to agree with him?\n\n\nVLADECK: No. The actual provision Abbott is purporting to rely on is part of Article I, § 10, which\xa0limits\xa0states’ powers. And it prohibits states from “engag[ing] in war” without congressional consent “unless actually invaded.”\n  \n\n      The point of this provision – adopted at a time when we had a tiny federal army, Congress was usually out of session and travel took weeks – was to allow states to defend themselves from foreign invaders\xa0until\xa0federal authorities arrived.\n  \n\n      It was never understood, and has never been understood, to allow states to interfere with or otherwise override federal law enforcement – even\xa0if\xa0it’s an “invasion” (which, it should be said, this isn’t).\n  \n\n      Were it otherwise, states could use their own claim of being “invaded” as a justification to resist whatever federal laws and policies that they didn’t like – a modern-day version of the “nullification” arguments that didn’t survive the Civil War.\n  \n\n    Abbott does have a point on one thing\n\n\nWOLF: Does Abbott have a point about the lack of clarity in the court’s ruling? When we last we spoke, it was about your own research on the\xa0shadow docket\xa0and the problem of the court wielding power without writing decisions.\n\n\nVLADECK: Yes. One of the real issues with the Supreme Court handing down such significant rulings without explanation, as I write about in\xa0“The Shadow Docket,” is the lack of guidance it provides to government officials, lower courts and the public about what is and what is not allowed going forward.\n  \n\n      Unfortunately, Monday’s ruling is a perfect example. Abbott is, quite obviously, provoking a fight over how far states can go to supplant, and not just supplement, federal law enforcement authority.\n  \n\n      Until and unless the Supreme Court conclusively answers that question, we’re going to be in this limbo – with the unseemly prospect of a physical standoff between state and federal officials in Texas while that question goes unanswered.\n  \n\n    Who is supposed to be in charge of immigration policy?\n\n\nWOLF: Why is it that immigration policy is set aside for the federal government?\n\n\nVLADECK: I don’t think it’s quite right to say that “immigration policy [is] set aside for the federal government.” The Constitution gives the federal government the power to regulate naturalization, which the Supreme Court has long interpreted to also include a power to regulate immigration and border security.\n  \n\n      But the Constitution leaves the\xa0extent\xa0of federal involvement almost entirely up to Congress.\n  \n\n      So part of the issue here is that, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, Congress has passed a number of statutes that\xa0themselves\xa0give the federal government a dominant role in both setting and implementing immigration policy.\n  \n\n      And once Congress has legislated, those statutes – and their enforcement – take constitutional precedence over any state policy to the contrary, no matter how much we might\xa0prefer\xa0what a state is doing to what the federal government is doing.\n  \n\n      As Justice Robert Jackson wrote for the Supreme Court in 1954, courts “cannot resolve conflicts of authority by our judgment as to the wisdom or need of either conflicting policy. The compact between the states creating the Federal Government resolves them as a matter of supremacy. However wise or needful [a state’s] policy, … it must give way to the contrary federal policy.”\n  \n\n      If we don’t like federal policy, the answer is to change it, not to let states override it.\n  \n\n    Congress keeps failing to act. Is this their fault?\n\n\nWOLF: There is a larger issue with our duct-taped immigration policy. Congress has been trying and failing for decades to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which has left the federal bureaucracy and the courts to fill in the blanks on outdated laws. Would a new comprehensive law solve the problem of these standoffs between border states and Democratic administrations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Guard soldiers stand guard on the banks of the Rio Grande river at Shelby Park on January 12, 2024 in Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\nBrandon Bell/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nThis is why nothing gets done in Congress on border policy\n\n\n\n\nVLADECK: There’s no question that Congress’ inability to enact comprehensive immigration reform is part of the issue here – because that gap has given presidents (of\xa0both\xa0parties) far more control over the contours of immigration policy than they would have if Congress were more invested in it.\n  \n\n      That, in turn, has led to far sharper conflicts between red states and Democratic presidents\xa0and\xa0between blue states and Republican presidents.\n  \n\n      And the fact that congressional Republicans at this exact moment are backing away from immigration reform because they’d rather\xa0run\xa0on border issues than fix them says a lot about both why Congress hasn’t solved these issues and why states are now (wrongly) taking it upon themselves to try to do so, or at least to try to look like they’re doing so.\n  \n\n    Is this a trend?\n\n\nWOLF: I am reminded of last year when Alabama legislators initially did not comply with a\xa0Supreme Court decision requiring a second majority-Black congressional district.\xa0The cases are different in many ways, but is there any similarity in the spirit of pushback against the court by Republican state officials? Is this a new phenomenon?\n\n\nVLADECK: As I’ve written\xa0for my Supreme Court newsletter, I don’t think it’s right to say that Alabama didn’t “comply” with the court’s ruling in\xa0Allen\xa0v.\xa0Milligan; they just tried to make an argument on remand that Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh had brought up but not addressed at the time of the court’s decision.\n  \n\n      Just like Abbott and Monday’s ruling, I don’t chalk either of these cases up to direct defiance of the court.\n  \n\n      That said, the calls we’ve seen this week from Republican elected officials at both the state and federal level\xa0to\xa0ignore the Supreme Court (which are also premised on a misunderstanding of what the court did and didn’t do) are more than a little alarming – and evidence of how the Supreme Court’s declining public credibility has ramifications not just for\xa0left-wing\xa0critics of the court, but for\xa0right-wing\xa0critics, too.\n  \n\n      It says a lot about where we are that even\xa0this\xa0Supreme Court isn’t far enough to the right to satisfy these politicians – and it says a lot about the costs of the eroding public confidence in the court that attacking the court from the\xa0right\xa0is becoming increasingly popular.\n  \n\n      Indeed, we’re seeing in real time exactly\xa0why\xa0it’s important for the court to have broad-spectrum support: So that if and when it\xa0does\xa0need to intervene more aggressively in disputes like the current conflict between the federal government and Texas, there are no serious doubts that it can and should resolve them.\n  \n\n    How would the court treat Trump’s promise of mass deportations?\n\n\nWOLF: Anything Republican governors are doing vis-a-vis the border should, I think, be viewed in the context of how a second Trump administration might play out. He has promised, for instance, mass deportations and camps modeled on the horribly named “Operation Wetback” of the 1950s. How do you think the court might view such a mass deportation effort?\n\n\nVLADECK: The reality, for better or worse, is that the Supreme Court has historically shown broad deference to executive branch immigration policies without regard to whether those policies were set by Democratic or Republican presidents.\n  \n\n      In a second Trump administration, I expect that the most serious challenges would be to how these policies infringed upon the\xa0rights\xa0of immigrants – as opposed to current challenges to the Biden administration, which are framed more in terms of federalism and states’ rights.\n  \n\n      To that end, I think the real precedent that these current disputes are going to set, one way or the other, is whether states really\xa0can\xa0have what are effectively their own immigration policies – whether because of a twisted reading of the “actually invaded” language of Article I, § 10 of the federal Constitution, or because the current Supreme Court is going to rein in the scope of federal preemption.\n  \n\n      The court’s 2012 ruling in\xa0Arizona\xa0v.\xa0United States, in which a 5-3 majority sided with the federal government to block most of an Arizona law that tried to create a form of state immigration policy, is looming increasingly large.\n  \n\n      But if what Texas is doing leads courts to give states more leeway to interfere with federal immigration policy, it’s hard to see why blue states won’t follow that roadmap during a second Trump administration.\n  \n\n      In the end, federalism isn’t partisan – which is exactly why those who are sympathetic to what Texas is doing as a matter of policy should nevertheless be more than a little alarmed by what it is doing as a matter of fundamental constitutional principles of federalism.', 'source': 'cnn'}

It’s unclear how that major difference would be resolved.\n  \n\n      Still, progress has been made on the parameters of a hostage deal that would occur in three stages, and include the release of civilians, soldiers and the bodies of those hostages who have died while being held in captivity.\n  \n\n      Burns’s meetings with Mossad director David Barnea, Egyptian intelligence director Abbas Kamel and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani are expected to\xa0take place in France\xa0over the weekend,\xa0according to two sources familiar. The CIA declined to comment on his travel.\n  \n\n      Burns and Barnea were central to a November agreement that resulted in a week-long pause in fighting in exchange for the release of more than 100 hostages.\n  \n\n      The talks are the latest in a spate of recent diplomatic efforts to free the more than 100 remaining hostages while moving toward a more prolonged cessation of hostilities.\xa0 The flurry of activity amounts to the most intensive effort in months to strike an agreement that could significantly alter the trajectory of the war in Gaza.\n  \n\n      Speaking from the White House on Friday afternoon, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby described the ongoing talks as productive but not yet reaching the point of success.\n  \n\n      “We’re hopeful about the progress, but I do not expect – we should not expect – any imminent developments,” Kirby said.\n  \n\n      He said on Friday, Biden had spoken to Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi as well as Qatar’s Emir\xa0Sheikh\xa0Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani\xa0to discuss ongoing hostage talks.\n  \n\n      “We continue to do everything we can to facilitate another hostage deal just like we did back in November,” Kirby said.\n  \n\n      A readout from the White House Friday said\xa0that Biden and Al Thani “affirmed that a hostage deal is central to establishing a prolonged humanitarian pause in the fighting and ensure additional life-saving humanitarian assistance reaches civilians in need throughout Gaza.”\n  \n\n      Both leaders “underscored the urgency of the situation” in their conversation, the readout noted.\n  \n\n      Kirby also said Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East, was returning to Washington on Friday from meetings in the region.\n  \n\n      He described those talks as a “good set of discussions.”\n  \n\n      “At every level, from the president right on down, we’re doing everything we can to bring these moms and dads, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters back home to their families,” Kirby said. “Our thoughts remain with them, of course their loved ones, as well as all of the innocent Palestinians that continue to be caught up in this war.”\n  \n\n      Qatar’s prime minister is expected to travel to Washington next week, a diplomatic source told CNN. Qatar has acted as a key broker in talks with Hamas.\n  \n\n      US officials are now hopeful for a much longer cessation in the fighting, believing it could provide\xa0space for\xa0more humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza as well as continued discussions about the future of Israel’s campaign against Hamas and the future of Gaza.\n  \n\n      Qatar, Egypt and the US have been working toward trying to find common ground in proposals that were put forward several weeks ago by both Hamas and Israel, according to an official familiar with the ongoing discussions. In the past week, Qatar sent back ideas to each of them, including a time frame of a two-month ceasefire that would see hostages released in phases.\n  \n\n      First to be released would be the remaining women, children and the elderly, followed by\xa0another\xa0phase that would include Israeli soldiers and the bodies of dead hostages.\n  \n\n      In exchange,\xa0Palestinians held in Israeli jails would be released in around a three-for-one exchange, akin to the deal struck last year, a second source familiar with the matter said, who said the\xa0process would take around a month.\n  \n\n      Each stage would come with a pause in fighting and the delivery of aid to the North and South of Gaza.\n  \n\n    Obstacles remain\n\n\n      The major sticking point for Hamas has been Israel’s refusal to discuss an end to the war past a temporary ceasefire. Israel’s focus, the official said, has been to try to discuss one phase at a time – with accompanying pauses and prisoner releases - while Hamas has pushed for a comprehensive plan that would include Israel agreeing to end the war against Hamas.\n  \n\n      As part of proposals currently being discussed, the end of the hostage release process would come with a permanent ceasefire, a step Israel has been unwilling to agree to.\n  \n\n      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, have said the war may continue for the rest of the year, if not into 2025. And Netanyahu has been increasingly public in his rejections of a Palestinian state, a priority item for Biden and the US.\n  \n\n      The Biden administration has been openly pressuring Israel to transition to a lower-intensity phase of operations, including in telephone calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n  \n\n      Aside from the Biden administration’s own interest in seeing a half dozen Israeli-American hostages released, US officials see a ceasefire deal and hostage release as the key to getting to a significant pause in the fighting that will help the flow of humanitarian aid and allow Palestinians to return to their homes, many of which have been destroyed.\n  \n\n      But with two key parties who have their own priorities, in addition to at least three main mediators, there is a complex array of ideas, proposals and initiatives being put forward.\n  \n\n      “These things are very fluid, they change every single minute,” the official said.\n  \n\n      Whether all parties can reach an agreement remains to be seen, and the talks will occur against the backdrop of renewed tensions between Israel and Qatar, sparked by leaked recording purported to be Netanyahu criticizing the Gulf state.\n  \n\n      Burns and McGurk’s discussions with regional players come amid tensions between Israel and Qatar over a leaked recording said to be of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticizing Qatar.\n  \n\n      On the recording, which aired on Israeli television, a voice purportedly Netanyahu’s describes Qatar as “problematic.” The speaker also says he is “very mad at the Americans” for renewing a lease on their military base in Qatar without extracting a concession on hostages from the country. CNN cannot verify that the voice on the leaked recording belongs to Benjamin Netanyahu.\n  \n\n      Responding to the tape, Qatar said Netanyahu was undermining mediation efforts in the Israel-Hamas war.\n  \n\n      The White House on Thursday reiterated its gratitude for Qatar — which has acted as a key mediator in hostage talks — in response to the leaked recording.\n  \n\n      “Qatar is a key partner in the region. We’re grateful for their support of our continued efforts to try to get hostages out of Gaza and reunited with their families,” Kirby said in a statement Thursday evening.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\n\n      CNN’s Betsy Klein and Katie Bo Lillis contributed reporting.', 'source': 'cnn'}

It’s unclear how that major difference would be resolved.\n  \n\n      Still, progress has been made on the parameters of a hostage deal that would occur in three stages, and include the release of civilians, soldiers and the bodies of those hostages who have died while being held in captivity.\n  \n\n      Burns’s meetings with Mossad director David Barnea, Egyptian intelligence director Abbas Kamel and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani are expected to\xa0take place in France\xa0over the weekend,\xa0according to two sources familiar. The CIA declined to comment on his travel.\n  \n\n      Burns and Barnea were central to a November agreement that resulted in a week-long pause in fighting in exchange for the release of more than 100 hostages.\n  \n\n      The talks are the latest in a spate of recent diplomatic efforts to free the more than 100 remaining hostages while moving toward a more prolonged cessation of hostilities.\xa0 The flurry of activity amounts to the most intensive effort in months to strike an agreement that could significantly alter the trajectory of the war in Gaza.\n  \n\n      Speaking from the White House on Friday afternoon, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby described the ongoing talks as productive but not yet reaching the point of success.\n  \n\n      “We’re hopeful about the progress, but I do not expect – we should not expect – any imminent developments,” Kirby said.\n  \n\n      He said on Friday, Biden had spoken to Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi as well as Qatar’s Emir\xa0Sheikh\xa0Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani\xa0to discuss ongoing hostage talks.\n  \n\n      “We continue to do everything we can to facilitate another hostage deal just like we did back in November,” Kirby said.\n  \n\n      A readout from the White House Friday said\xa0that Biden and Al Thani “affirmed that a hostage deal is central to establishing a prolonged humanitarian pause in the fighting and ensure additional life-saving humanitarian assistance reaches civilians in need throughout Gaza.”\n  \n\n      Both leaders “underscored the urgency of the situation” in their conversation, the readout noted.\n  \n\n      Kirby also said Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East, was returning to Washington on Friday from meetings in the region.\n  \n\n      He described those talks as a “good set of discussions.”\n  \n\n      “At every level, from the president right on down, we’re doing everything we can to bring these moms and dads, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters back home to their families,” Kirby said. “Our thoughts remain with them, of course their loved ones, as well as all of the innocent Palestinians that continue to be caught up in this war.”\n  \n\n      Qatar’s prime minister is expected to travel to Washington next week, a diplomatic source told CNN. Qatar has acted as a key broker in talks with Hamas.\n  \n\n      US officials are now hopeful for a much longer cessation in the fighting, believing it could provide\xa0space for\xa0more humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza as well as continued discussions about the future of Israel’s campaign against Hamas and the future of Gaza.\n  \n\n      Qatar, Egypt and the US have been working toward trying to find common ground in proposals that were put forward several weeks ago by both Hamas and Israel, according to an official familiar with the ongoing discussions. In the past week, Qatar sent back ideas to each of them, including a time frame of a two-month ceasefire that would see hostages released in phases.\n  \n\n      First to be released would be the remaining women, children and the elderly, followed by\xa0another\xa0phase that would include Israeli soldiers and the bodies of dead hostages.\n  \n\n      In exchange,\xa0Palestinians held in Israeli jails would be released in around a three-for-one exchange, akin to the deal struck last year, a second source familiar with the matter said, who said the\xa0process would take around a month.\n  \n\n      Each stage would come with a pause in fighting and the delivery of aid to the North and South of Gaza.\n  \n\n    Obstacles remain\n\n\n      The major sticking point for Hamas has been Israel’s refusal to discuss an end to the war past a temporary ceasefire. Israel’s focus, the official said, has been to try to discuss one phase at a time – with accompanying pauses and prisoner releases - while Hamas has pushed for a comprehensive plan that would include Israel agreeing to end the war against Hamas.\n  \n\n      As part of proposals currently being discussed, the end of the hostage release process would come with a permanent ceasefire, a step Israel has been unwilling to agree to.\n  \n\n      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, have said the war may continue for the rest of the year, if not into 2025. And Netanyahu has been increasingly public in his rejections of a Palestinian state, a priority item for Biden and the US.\n  \n\n      The Biden administration has been openly pressuring Israel to transition to a lower-intensity phase of operations, including in telephone calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n  \n\n      Aside from the Biden administration’s own interest in seeing a half dozen Israeli-American hostages released, US officials see a ceasefire deal and hostage release as the key to getting to a significant pause in the fighting that will help the flow of humanitarian aid and allow Palestinians to return to their homes, many of which have been destroyed.\n  \n\n      But with two key parties who have their own priorities, in addition to at least three main mediators, there is a complex array of ideas, proposals and initiatives being put forward.\n  \n\n      “These things are very fluid, they change every single minute,” the official said.\n  \n\n      Whether all parties can reach an agreement remains to be seen, and the talks will occur against the backdrop of renewed tensions between Israel and Qatar, sparked by leaked recording purported to be Netanyahu criticizing the Gulf state.\n  \n\n      Burns and McGurk’s discussions with regional players come amid tensions between Israel and Qatar over a leaked recording said to be of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticizing Qatar.\n  \n\n      On the recording, which aired on Israeli television, a voice purportedly Netanyahu’s describes Qatar as “problematic.” The speaker also says he is “very mad at the Americans” for renewing a lease on their military base in Qatar without extracting a concession on hostages from the country. CNN cannot verify that the voice on the leaked recording belongs to Benjamin Netanyahu.\n  \n\n      Responding to the tape, Qatar said Netanyahu was undermining mediation efforts in the Israel-Hamas war.\n  \n\n      The White House on Thursday reiterated its gratitude for Qatar — which has acted as a key mediator in hostage talks — in response to the leaked recording.\n  \n\n      “Qatar is a key partner in the region. We’re grateful for their support of our continued efforts to try to get hostages out of Gaza and reunited with their families,” Kirby said in a statement Thursday evening.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\n\n      CNN’s Betsy Klein and Katie Bo Lillis contributed reporting.', 'source': 'cnn', 'embeddings': None}['paragraphs'][:100]

Greg Abbott said this week he will continue to defend his state’s border despite a 5-4 Supreme Court order that the US Border Patrol can take down razor wire Texas set up along portions of the US border with Mexico.\n  \n\n      Questioning the court’s action, the Republican governor criticized its lack of clarity when it sided with the Biden administration, which wants to remove the razor wire while a legal challenge to Abbott’s actions plays out.\n  \n\n      “There were no sentences, or paragraphs or pages of an opinion written by the Supreme Court, so no one knows at all what they were thinking – all we know is that they wanted to send it back to the 5th\xa0Circuit,” Abbott said on Fox News, arguing, “There was no opinion about anything – about razor wire, what Texas is doing or anything like that.”\n  \n\n      The razor wire issue is playing out as part of a larger standoff in which Abbott argues by not acting more forcefully at the border, the federal government has violated its responsibility to protect the state from “invasion.”\n  \n\n      Is this a governor essentially ignoring the Supreme Court? Why is the federal government in charge of border policy in the first place? I went to CNN’s Supreme Court analyst Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, with those questions. Our conversation, conducted by email, is below.\n  \n\n    Abbott is not ignoring the Supreme Court\n\n\nWOLF: How does Abbott justify essentially ignoring the Supreme Court?\n\n\nVLADECK: It’s really important to stress that two different things are true: First, Abbott is\xa0not\xa0“essentially ignoring” the Supreme Court. Second, he\xa0is\xa0interfering with federal authority to a degree we haven’t seen from state officials since the desegregation cases of the 1950s and 1960s.\n  \n\n      With regard to the court, all that the justices did on Monday was to vacate a lower-court injunction, which had itself prohibited federal officials from cutting or otherwise removing razor wire that Texas officials have placed along or near the US-Mexico border.\n  \n\n      Nothing in Monday’s unexplained order stops Abbott from doing anything; it just means the\xa0federal government\xa0can’t be sanctioned by courts if it takes steps to remove those obstacles.\n  \n\n      Instead, the real issue here is that Abbott is deliberately impeding the ability of federal officials to act in and around Eagle Pass – in a way that isn’t in outright defiance of the Supreme Court (yet), but that\xa0is\xa0inconsistent with the supremacy of federal law.\n  \n\n      That’s why Abbott is trying to invoke a claim that the federal Constitution itself authorizes what he’s doing, because if the Constitution doesn’t empower him to take these steps, then “preemption” (the idea that federal statutes and federal policies promulgated pursuant to those statutes override contrary state laws and policies) should be the whole ballgame here.\n  \n\n    Abbott misuses the Constitution to declare an ‘invasion’\n\n\nWOLF: Abbott has tried to justify his actions at the border by declaring an “invasion” in Texas. That language has been used for political reasons by Republican lawmakers. But it also has legal importance in the Constitution. Is the Supreme Court likely to agree with him?\n\n\nVLADECK: No. The actual provision Abbott is purporting to rely on is part of Article I, § 10, which\xa0limits\xa0states’ powers. And it prohibits states from “engag[ing] in war” without congressional consent “unless actually invaded.”\n  \n\n      The point of this provision – adopted at a time when we had a tiny federal army, Congress was usually out of session and travel took weeks – was to allow states to defend themselves from foreign invaders\xa0until\xa0federal authorities arrived.\n  \n\n      It was never understood, and has never been understood, to allow states to interfere with or otherwise override federal law enforcement – even\xa0if\xa0it’s an “invasion” (which, it should be said, this isn’t).\n  \n\n      Were it otherwise, states could use their own claim of being “invaded” as a justification to resist whatever federal laws and policies that they didn’t like – a modern-day version of the “nullification” arguments that didn’t survive the Civil War.\n  \n\n    Abbott does have a point on one thing\n\n\nWOLF: Does Abbott have a point about the lack of clarity in the court’s ruling? When we last we spoke, it was about your own research on the\xa0shadow docket\xa0and the problem of the court wielding power without writing decisions.\n\n\nVLADECK: Yes. One of the real issues with the Supreme Court handing down such significant rulings without explanation, as I write about in\xa0“The Shadow Docket,” is the lack of guidance it provides to government officials, lower courts and the public about what is and what is not allowed going forward.\n  \n\n      Unfortunately, Monday’s ruling is a perfect example. Abbott is, quite obviously, provoking a fight over how far states can go to supplant, and not just supplement, federal law enforcement authority.\n  \n\n      Until and unless the Supreme Court conclusively answers that question, we’re going to be in this limbo – with the unseemly prospect of a physical standoff between state and federal officials in Texas while that question goes unanswered.\n  \n\n    Who is supposed to be in charge of immigration policy?\n\n\nWOLF: Why is it that immigration policy is set aside for the federal government?\n\n\nVLADECK: I don’t think it’s quite right to say that “immigration policy [is] set aside for the federal government.” The Constitution gives the federal government the power to regulate naturalization, which the Supreme Court has long interpreted to also include a power to regulate immigration and border security.\n  \n\n      But the Constitution leaves the\xa0extent\xa0of federal involvement almost entirely up to Congress.\n  \n\n      So part of the issue here is that, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, Congress has passed a number of statutes that\xa0themselves\xa0give the federal government a dominant role in both setting and implementing immigration policy.\n  \n\n      And once Congress has legislated, those statutes – and their enforcement – take constitutional precedence over any state policy to the contrary, no matter how much we might\xa0prefer\xa0what a state is doing to what the federal government is doing.\n  \n\n      As Justice Robert Jackson wrote for the Supreme Court in 1954, courts “cannot resolve conflicts of authority by our judgment as to the wisdom or need of either conflicting policy. The compact between the states creating the Federal Government resolves them as a matter of supremacy. However wise or needful [a state’s] policy, … it must give way to the contrary federal policy.”\n  \n\n      If we don’t like federal policy, the answer is to change it, not to let states override it.\n  \n\n    Congress keeps failing to act. Is this their fault?\n\n\nWOLF: There is a larger issue with our duct-taped immigration policy. Congress has been trying and failing for decades to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which has left the federal bureaucracy and the courts to fill in the blanks on outdated laws. Would a new comprehensive law solve the problem of these standoffs between border states and Democratic administrations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Guard soldiers stand guard on the banks of the Rio Grande river at Shelby Park on January 12, 2024 in Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\nBrandon Bell/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nThis is why nothing gets done in Congress on border policy\n\n\n\n\nVLADECK: There’s no question that Congress’ inability to enact comprehensive immigration reform is part of the issue here – because that gap has given presidents (of\xa0both\xa0parties) far more control over the contours of immigration policy than they would have if Congress were more invested in it.\n  \n\n      That, in turn, has led to far sharper conflicts between red states and Democratic presidents\xa0and\xa0between blue states and Republican presidents.\n  \n\n      And the fact that congressional Republicans at this exact moment are backing away from immigration reform because they’d rather\xa0run\xa0on border issues than fix them says a lot about both why Congress hasn’t solved these issues and why states are now (wrongly) taking it upon themselves to try to do so, or at least to try to look like they’re doing so.\n  \n\n    Is this a trend?\n\n\nWOLF: I am reminded of last year when Alabama legislators initially did not comply with a\xa0Supreme Court decision requiring a second majority-Black congressional district.\xa0The cases are different in many ways, but is there any similarity in the spirit of pushback against the court by Republican state officials? Is this a new phenomenon?\n\n\nVLADECK: As I’ve written\xa0for my Supreme Court newsletter, I don’t think it’s right to say that Alabama didn’t “comply” with the court’s ruling in\xa0Allen\xa0v.\xa0Milligan; they just tried to make an argument on remand that Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh had brought up but not addressed at the time of the court’s decision.\n  \n\n      Just like Abbott and Monday’s ruling, I don’t chalk either of these cases up to direct defiance of the court.\n  \n\n      That said, the calls we’ve seen this week from Republican elected officials at both the state and federal level\xa0to\xa0ignore the Supreme Court (which are also premised on a misunderstanding of what the court did and didn’t do) are more than a little alarming – and evidence of how the Supreme Court’s declining public credibility has ramifications not just for\xa0left-wing\xa0critics of the court, but for\xa0right-wing\xa0critics, too.\n  \n\n      It says a lot about where we are that even\xa0this\xa0Supreme Court isn’t far enough to the right to satisfy these politicians – and it says a lot about the costs of the eroding public confidence in the court that attacking the court from the\xa0right\xa0is becoming increasingly popular.\n  \n\n      Indeed, we’re seeing in real time exactly\xa0why\xa0it’s important for the court to have broad-spectrum support: So that if and when it\xa0does\xa0need to intervene more aggressively in disputes like the current conflict between the federal government and Texas, there are no serious doubts that it can and should resolve them.\n  \n\n    How would the court treat Trump’s promise of mass deportations?\n\n\nWOLF: Anything Republican governors are doing vis-a-vis the border should, I think, be viewed in the context of how a second Trump administration might play out. He has promised, for instance, mass deportations and camps modeled on the horribly named “Operation Wetback” of the 1950s. How do you think the court might view such a mass deportation effort?\n\n\nVLADECK: The reality, for better or worse, is that the Supreme Court has historically shown broad deference to executive branch immigration policies without regard to whether those policies were set by Democratic or Republican presidents.\n  \n\n      In a second Trump administration, I expect that the most serious challenges would be to how these policies infringed upon the\xa0rights\xa0of immigrants – as opposed to current challenges to the Biden administration, which are framed more in terms of federalism and states’ rights.\n  \n\n      To that end, I think the real precedent that these current disputes are going to set, one way or the other, is whether states really\xa0can\xa0have what are effectively their own immigration policies – whether because of a twisted reading of the “actually invaded” language of Article I, § 10 of the federal Constitution, or because the current Supreme Court is going to rein in the scope of federal preemption.\n  \n\n      The court’s 2012 ruling in\xa0Arizona\xa0v.\xa0United States, in which a 5-3 majority sided with the federal government to block most of an Arizona law that tried to create a form of state immigration policy, is looming increasingly large.\n  \n\n      But if what Texas is doing leads courts to give states more leeway to interfere with federal immigration policy, it’s hard to see why blue states won’t follow that roadmap during a second Trump administration.\n  \n\n      In the end, federalism isn’t partisan – which is exactly why those who are sympathetic to what Texas is doing as a matter of policy should nevertheless be more than a little alarmed by what it is doing as a matter of fundamental constitutional principles of federalism.', 'source': 'cnn', 'embeddings': None}['paragraphs'][:100]

The plan would also put pressure on Republicans to decide whether to greenlight these new authorities or reject the plan as Trump has urged the GOP to defeat anything short of what he calls a “perfect” bill.\n  \n\nBiden, in a rare statement on ongoing congressional negotiations, said the deal that Senate negotiators have worked toward is both tough and fair.\n  \n\n      “What’s been negotiated would – if passed into law – be the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the\xa0border\xa0we’ve ever had in our country,” he said in the statement Friday. “It would give me, as President, a new emergency authority to\xa0shut\xa0down\xa0the\xa0border\xa0when it becomes overwhelmed. And if given that authority, I would use it the day I sign the bill into law.”\n  \n\n      Under the soon-to-be-released package, the Department of Homeland Security would be granted new emergency authority to shut down the border if daily average migrant encounters reach\xa04,000 over a one-week span. If migrant crossings increase above 5,000 on average per day on a given week,\xa0DHS would be required to close the border to migrants crossing illegally not entering at ports of entry. Certain migrants would be allowed to stay if they prove to be fleeing torture or persecution in their countries.\n  \n\n      Moreover, if crossings exceed 8,500 in a single day, DHS would be required to close the border to migrants illegally crossing the border. Under the proposal, any migrant who tries to cross the border twice while it is closed would be banned from entering the US for one year.\n  \n\n      The goal of the trio of negotiators – GOP Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut – is to prevent surges that overwhelm federal authorities. The Biden administration and Senate leaders have been heavily involved in the talks,\xa0and more details of the deal are expected to be released in the coming days.\n  \n\n      In December alone, there were over 300,000 migrant encounters. The source said if the new legislation were in effect, the border would be shut down now to illegal migrants. Another source familiar with the matter said that certain migrants would be allowed to stay if they show they are fleeing persecution — and that there would still be a minimum of 1,400 asylum applications that could be processed though legal ports of entry while the emergency authorities are in effect.\n  \n\n      But the push to release a deal comes as Trump has rallied Republicans to reject any immigration compromise as he campaigns against Biden’s handling of the border. But a number of top Senate Republicans, including Mitch McConnell, say that the issue must be dealt with now since Democrats are willing to approve tougher restrictions.\n  \n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional reporting.\n\n\n      CNN’s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.', 'source': 'cnn', 'embeddings': None}['paragraphs'][:100]

How do you think the court might view such a mass deportation effort?\\n\\n\\nVLADECK: The reality, for better or worse, is that the Supreme Court has historically shown broad deference to executive branch immigration policies without regard to whether those policies were set by Democratic or Republican presidents.\\n  \\n\\n      In a second Trump administration, I expect that the most serious challenges would be to how these policies infringed upon the\\u00a0rights\\u00a0of immigrants \\u2013 as opposed to current challenges to the Biden administration, which are framed more in terms of federalism and states\\u2019 rights.\\n  \\n\\n      To that end, I think the real precedent that these current disputes are going to set, one way or the other, is whether states really\\u00a0can\\u00a0have what are effectively their own immigration policies \\u2013 whether because of a twisted reading of the \\u201cactually invaded\\u201d language of Article I, \\u00a7 10 of the federal Constitution, or because the current Supreme Court is going to rein in the scope of federal preemption.\\n  \\n\\n      The court\\u2019s 2012 ruling in\\u00a0Arizona\\u00a0v.\\u00a0United States, in which a 5-3 majority sided with the federal government to block most of an Arizona law that tried to create a form of state immigration policy, is looming increasingly large.\\n  \\n\\n      But if what Texas is doing leads courts to give states more leeway to interfere with federal immigration policy, it\\u2019s hard to see why blue states won\\u2019t follow that roadmap during a second Trump administration.\\n  \\n\\n      In the end, federalism isn\\u2019t partisan \\u2013 which is exactly why those who are sympathetic to what Texas is doing as a matter of policy should nevertheless be more than a little alarmed by what it is doing as a matter of fundamental constitutional principles of federalism.", "source": "cnn", "embeddings": null}'

For everyone who is demanding tougher border control, this is the way to do it. If you’re serious about the border crisis, pass a bipartisan bill and I will sign it.”\n  \n\n      Biden took office pledging to restore asylum and manage the border in a “humane” way.\xa0But his administration has faced the harsh realities and challenges at the US-Mexico border amid record migration across the Western Hemisphere — making it a political vulnerability seized on by Republicans.\n  \n\n      In recent weeks, Trump has lobbied Republicans to oppose the border compromise being delicately hashed out in the Senate because he wants to campaign on the issue this November.\n  \n\n      Over the course of his administration, Biden has leaned on more restrictive measures to try to stem the flow of migration, but Friday’s statement revealed a tougher stance as the president tries to control an issue that’s dogged him, while risking putting him at odds with some allies.\n  \n\n      “(The compromise) would give me, as President, a new emergency authority to shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed. And if given that authority, I would use it the day I sign the bill into law,” Biden’s statement said.\n  \n\n      Biden’s embrace of an authority that would allow him to shut down the border in the event of a migrant surge was striking to current and former administration officials, as well as to immigrant advocates.\n  \n\n      Johnson on Saturday attacked Biden over his endorsement of the potential border deal, arguing the president can take executive action without Congress to clamp down on migrant crossings.\n  \n\n      And in his first statement on the Senate deal, Johnson claimed that it would force the US to surrender to illegal migration. “According to reports, the Senate’s pending proposal would expressly allow as many as 150,000 illegal crossings each month (1.8 million per year) before any new ‘shutdown’ authority could be used. At that point, America will have already been surrendered,” Johnson said in the statement.\n  \n\n      A source familiar with the Senate deal, however, said Johnson is providing a false interpretation of the proposal. The source said that once border crossings reach a level requiring the Department of Homeland Security to take emergency measures, federal authorities would be required to significantly restrict illegal border crossings until the US sees fewer than 2,000 migrants approach the border per day over a two-week span.\n  \n\n      Under the soon-to-be-released package, the Department of Homeland Security would be granted new emergency authority to shut down the border if daily average migrants crossing unlawfully reach\xa04,000 over a one-week span.

At that point, America will have already been surrendered,\\u201d Johnson said in the statement.\\n  \\n\\n      A source familiar with the Senate deal, however, said Johnson is providing a false interpretation of the proposal. The source said that once border crossings reach a level requiring the Department of Homeland Security to take emergency measures, federal authorities would be required to significantly restrict illegal border crossings until the US sees fewer than 2,000 migrants approach the border per day over a two-week span.\\n  \\n\\n      Under the soon-to-be-released package, the Department of Homeland Security would be granted new emergency authority to shut down the border if daily average migrants crossing unlawfully reach\\u00a04,000 over a one-week span.

Rashida Tlaib pressed undecided voters in Michigan to throw their support behind Joe Biden.\n  \n\n      In a virtual rally alongside other lawmakers, the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress was clear in her enthusiasm for Biden, arguing that he would create a better future for Americans.\n  \n\n      “This election … has to be a huge turnout, one that for me has to speak volumes. People say your vote is your voice; well, I want the voice to be a bullhorn,” she said, adding, “I want it to be so loud and so echoey that people understand exactly what we all believe in, which is, we believe that government must be about people.”\n  \n\n      More than three years later, the silence from Tlaib and other Muslim leaders on the president’s 2024 reelection bid is speaking volumes as Biden continues to back Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza.\n  \n\n      Tlaib – a liberal firebrand who represents parts of Detroit and its suburbs – accused the president in November of supporting a Palestinian “genocide,” straining her relationship with Biden. Her office declined multiple requests for comment on whether she would support the president in his reelection bid.\n  \n\n      The distance between Tlaib and the White House is reflective of the work Biden must do to repair the relationship with a key part of his coalition.\xa0Many Arab Americans and Muslim voters who have spoken to CNN say they will not support Biden’s reelection efforts due to his unwavering support of Israel and failure to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. But the problems go beyond that\xa0– Democratic strategists who spoke to CNN are warning that the president may struggle to find surrogates willing to take on the task of speaking to key voter groups such as Muslims, Arab Americans and angered progressives.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Burns, nominee for Central Intelligence Agency director, testifies during his Senate Select Intelligence Committee confirmation hearing, Wednesday, Feb. 24, 2021, on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n\nTom Williams/Pool/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nEfforts to secure hostage deal and pause in Gaza fighting step up as Biden dispatches CIA chief for crucial talks in Europe\n\n\n\n\n      The\xa0administration appears to be struggling with finding Arab American and Muslim leaders who are willing to even meet with White House officials, and\xa0no Muslim or Arab American groups have endorsed Biden’s reelection bid.\n  \n\n      But multiple local leaders declined invitations to meet with Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden’s campaign manager. Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, the city’s first Arab American and Muslim mayor who represents one of the country’s largest Muslim populations,\xa0told CNN Friday that he declined the meeting because “this is not a time for electoral politics” and that a conversation about change would be “with policymakers. Not campaign staff.”\n  \n\n      “If President Biden would\xa0want to come and have a real\xa0conversation about how he\xa0changes course, about his\xa0actions, decisions that he’s\xa0made overseas upon calling for\xa0an immediate ceasefire, we can\xa0entertain such a conversation and sit down,” Hammoud told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source.”\n  \n\n      In a previous interview with CNN, Hammoud said he would be willing to meet with the president if there was a\xa0“an opportunity to have a real constructive dialogue about how we move forward.”\n  \n\n      “But if it’s just an opportunity to take pictures and to say that ‘we listened,’ but nothing is changing, then it’s not a table worth sitting at,” he told CNN.\n  \n\n      A\xa0White House spokesperson told CNN its officials have\xa0“had more than 100 conversations with leaders at the local and state level concerning the conflict and humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza.”\n  \n\n      In addition, the spokesperson added that the\xa0White House offices of Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Engagement have consistently engaged with community leaders and elected officials since the October 7 attacks.\n  \n\n      Recently, a staffer in Vice President Kamala Harris’ office reached out to a prominent figure within the Arab American community in Michigan to see whether they would meet with Harris as the vice president wanted to speak with community leaders, according to a person familiar with these conversations.\n  \n\n      The individual declined the request, stating the administration has continued to “ignore” Arab Americans following the October 7 attack, the person said.\xa0Harris’ office said in a statement to CNN that\xa0“the President and Vice President have made it a priority to hear directly from Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim communities of America on the conflict in Gaza.”\n  \n\n      “(Harris) has also spoken to Hanan Shaheen, the mother of Wadee Alfayoumi, the 6-year-old Palestinian-American who was killed in October in Illinois. The President and Vice President will continue to listen and engage directly with these communities,” the statement said.\n  \n\n    Discord becoming all too apparent\n\n\n      Biden has not been able to ignore the discord within his own party as he attempts to turn the page to a general election campaign, as cries of “Genocide Joe” and “ceasefire now” follow him around the campaign trail.\n  \n\n      Democratic strategist Adrian Hemond said the president should be concerned about the lack of support he is getting among these communities, particularly in Michigan, which is home to more than 200,000 Muslim American voters.\n  \n\n      “He’s got a little bit of a political tightrope to walk right now,” said Hemond, who is based in Michigan. “A lot of them are going to respond by staying home because they think both their options are bad. And I think that’s a pretty good descriptor of Arab American voters right now.”\n  \n\n      The ceasefire calls are coming from a diversity of progressive groups, including those representing Jewish voters, voters of color and young people – key parts of Biden’s winning 2020 coalition.\n  \n\n      Chavez Rodriguez’s Michigan meetings, the source familiar said, are part of a routine dialogue with constituency groups and “have been in the works for several weeks” as the Biden campaign looks to engage with grassroots leaders.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS President Joe Biden at the United Auto Workers (UAW) conference in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Jan. 24, 2024.

The campaign reached out again this week and asked whether he’d help organize a meeting with members of the community and Chavez Rodriguez for Friday.\n  \n\n      He was working toward assembling a meeting of 10 to 15 members of the Arab American and Muslim community, including some local elected officials, for Friday afternoon, but they ultimately decided not to move forward.\n  \n\n      “I gauged the pulse of the community, and the war in Gaza’s been going on for 111 days. There’s 30,000 dead people. Fifty percent of the population is living in hunger. There’s no functioning hospitals and ultimately there’s been 111 days to able to call for a ceasefire,” he said. “At the end of the day, people look at us as leaders, and we’ve got to make a leadership decision and we’ve got to do what’s in the best interest of our community.”\n  \n\n      Osama Siblani, a Dearborn community leader and publisher of the Arab American News, was among those who did meet with Chavez Rodriguez on Friday morning, calling the 90-minute conversation “direct and frank.”\n  \n\n      “I looked her in the eyes and told her how I and my community feel about Biden,” said Siblani, who is Lebanese American.\n  \n\n    Potential backers stay silent\n\n\n      The White House has tried to quell criticism of the president’s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict by holding listening sessions for groups from inside and outside of the government. It also deployed Dilawar Syed – the deputy administrator of the US Small Business Administration who is one of the highest-ranking Muslim officials in the Biden administration – to a vigil for the\xa06-year-old Palestinian American boy, stabbed to death because he was Muslim.\n  \n\n      But those efforts have failed to quell frustrations among sections of Biden’s 2020 coalition.\n  \n\n      “To discount the anger from Arab voters, Muslim voters and voters of color across the country who also overwhelmingly support a ceasefire is discounting core parts of (Biden’s) base and the core base of the Democratic Party that has – election after election – elected Democrats and served as the reason Democrats beat Republicans in every campaign cycle that they do,” said Usamah Andrabi, the communications director for Justice Democrats, a progressive grassroots organization.\n  \n\n      In the last presidential election cycle, Biden received the support of several prominent Muslim American elected officials and community leaders. But this time around, many are skeptical – and angry.\n  \n\n      “I believe he is beyond redemption,” said Khalid Turaani, 57, a consultant based in Michigan and co-chair of the state’s chapter of the Abandon Biden movement. “I will not vote for Joe Biden. I believe that his complicity and his active participation in the genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza disqualify him from my vote.”\n  \n\n      “I just feel very, very angry that I voted for such a person that would enable such atrocities,” said Farah Khan, an IT specialist in Northville, Michigan.\n  \n\n      At least 146,620 of the 200,000 Muslim American voters in Michigan cast a ballot in the 2020 election cycle, according to an analysis by Emgage. In 2020, Biden won Michigan by three percentage points over Trump. Four years prior, Trump won the state over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton by 0.2 percentage points.\n  \n\n      Muslim leaders within the Abandon Biden movement, a national campaign working against Biden’s reelection efforts, say they operate in crucial swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota, Florida, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania to get voters not to support Biden.\n  \n\n      Nabila Taha, a Pennsylvania resident who spoke at an Abandon Biden news conference in Washington, DC, this month, said she would do everything possible to ensure Biden will not win in 2024.\n  \n\n      “We will go knocking on every door … telling them the story of the billions that they are sending over to kill our brothers and sisters instead of spending it here on our schools, while our senior citizens are fighting to choose between eating or paying for medications,” Taha said.\n  \n\n    Abandoning the president\n\n\n      The Abandon Biden campaign was created in Minnesota after a group of Muslim Americans demanded the president call for a ceasefire by October 31. And when Biden didn’t respond to these calls to support a permanent halt in fighting, the group vowed to campaign against him.\n  \n\n      When a reporter asked Biden whether he were concerned about Arab American voters who said they would not support him, he responded, “The former president wants to put a ban on Arabs coming into the country. … We understand who cares about the Arab population.”\n  \n\n      Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign’s communications director, told reporters on Wednesday that the president will “continue to engage in conversations with the Arab American community.”\n  \n\n      “We believe that it’s important to have consistent conversations with folks, even when they disagree with you on a policy position,” he said.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks to United Auto Workers members at the UAW's Community Action Program legislative conference in Washington, DC, on January 24.\n\nLeah Millis/Reuters\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nBiden’s campaign headaches on display in repeat public interruptions\n\n\n\n\n      But it is still unclear whether Biden or Harris plans to visit Michigan or other states to engage with Arab American and Muslim voters specifically. Some Arab American and Muslim voters say even if Biden’s campaign ramps up their outreach, it will be too late.\n  \n\n      “I feel used as a Muslim voter,” said Ariana Afshar, 27, a content creator based in California. “He used people like myself in order to get elected and is now doing whatever serves him in his position.”\n  \n\n      “Outreach will not work here,” said Hassan Abdel Salam, a human rights professor at the University of Minnesota and co-founder of the Abandon Biden campaign. “When you conduct this type of campaign of death, and it lasts over 100 days, there is no way that any outreach can reverse the decisions they’ve done.”\n  \n\n      “There is no possibility of repair while he is supporting an act of genocide. So, there is no reason to have communication,” said Dawud Walid, the executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n  \n\n      Some Michigan voters told CNN that they would rather support a third-party candidate or Trump if it means Biden will lose in 2024.\n  \n\n      “If it’s neck and neck, and in order to get Biden to lose it will require me to vote for Trump, then absolutely I will do that. I will do exactly that,” said Samraa Luqman, 41, a real estate agent who did not vote for Biden or Trump in the last presidential election cycle.\n  \n\n      She added: “I never in my life thought I would say that. … They have really screwed up this time.”\n  \n\n      CNN’s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report.", 'source': 'cnn', 'embeddings': None}['paragraphs'][:100]
