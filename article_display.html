        <div class="preview">
             Growing up in the US, I always felt inclined to connect with people through what I shared with them. From as far back as I can remember, connecting through similarities was the default tactic for navigating conversations with strangers and initiating friendships. When I was younger, these interests included Barbie, books such as "Where the Wild Things Are," and Nickelodeon's ugly cartoons. Over time, my cultural fabric eventually broadened to encompass a wider collection of things as I entered preadolescence: whichever movie Leonardo DiCaprio was in, boy bands, and Britney Spears through all of her phases. While my mom and I had a celebrated tradition of watching films from the mid-20th century, including those of Alfred Hitchcock and ones based on Rodgers and Hammerstein works, I never connected with peers through this. When I brought it up, it would often have the effect of deflating conversation. When Super Bowl season rolled around, the big game was a character of its own at the dinner tables of friends and colleagues, and even at dive bars. Even though I never watched it for the football, I'd at least want to be in the know about the halftime show or the ads. It was the same thing with "Survivor" or "The Bachelor" or even tabloid headlines — I didn't have to like it to want to know about it or have an opinion on it. These cultural phenomena invited inclusivity. They were the currency of social exchange. At most of the dinner parties I've attended in the US, these sorts of topics were the adhesive for all the guests, while eccentricities felt better saved for the kind of one-on-one sharing that might happen in the faded early morning hours of an after-party or a sneaky rendezvous with a lover. And discussing politics at the dinner table in the States always felt taboo, unless everyone was nodding in agreement. Though I'd occasionally find exceptions to these generalizations, it was typically in intentionally iconoclastic settings, including Burning Man. I moved to Europe seven years ago and spent time in Italy, Switzerland, France, Spain, and the UK. I'm currently living in Portugal, and during my time abroad, I've noticed that conversational glue tends to be of a different nature. Instead of people circumventing oddities or the unfamiliar, the norm was to dive straight into them. I remember a New Year's Eve party in the south of France when this girl grabbed the speaker in the middle of dinner, emphatically insisting we listen to a "Brazilian mermaid." The song was "Água de Beber" by Astrud Gilberto. I loved it — not just the song but also the whole moment. No one felt the need to pretend they were already familiar with the music, and there was no discomfort with the unknown, just pure curiosity. She just put it on, and everyone listened hungrily, asking questions and wanting more. It became an inadvertent listening party. Not only do many people I've met here have their own well-developed niche interests — like my fascination with the midcentury films I watched with my mom as a kid — but they also share a genuine desire to dive into each other's curiosities. For example, my ex-boyfriend's little sister was obsessed with manga. His whole 10-person family would eagerly inquire about it at dinner; even his friends would ask her about it when they were over at his house. A Portuguese friend was deeply into the philosophy of Heidegger and never shy to talk about it with an idle ear at the bar — even with those who had no taste for philosophy. And here, talking about politics is welcomed, especially if people are not in agreement. I've begun to feel like Europe is characterized by a decentralized idea of culture and identity. I should note these observations are generalizations — and, naturally, there are always exceptions, except for (non-American) football. Everyone knows something about that here. Of course, there may be a few explanations for what I've observed. The whole world could be changing, becoming more interested in differences than in similarities. Or it could be that I'm changing, along with my perception of myself, the world, and the people I surround myself with. Either way, I wonder whether there's meaning to be found in the evolution of the topics I find myself discussing. Though I'm not sure there's a correct answer, I've found beauty in seeing others through the lenses of both our similarities and our differences. Read next Jump to

            Indonesia, the third-largest democracy in the world, is voting on 14 February in just its sixth election since it emerged from a military dictatorship in the 1990s. It's a three-way race for the top job, between current Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto and two former governors, Anies Baswedan and Ganjar Pranowo. One of them will succeed President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, who has served two full terms. Mr Widodo remains hugely popular but his legacy has been tainted by accusations that he's sought to retain political influence through his eldest son, who is running alongside Mr Prabowo, a military commander under the Suharto regime. It has prompted fears that Indonesia is in danger of sliding back towards its authoritarian past. The outcome of the election will also have an effect far beyond Indonesia, with the winner having to contend with the growing US-China rivalry in the Indo-Pacific region. The frontrunner to be Indonesia's next president has tried desperately to soften his strongman image but to some voters he is still associated with abuses committed during General Suharto's dictatorship. The 72-year-old Mr Prabowo was a military general who married one of General Suharto's daughters. He came from a wealthy political family but the first half of his career was dedicated to the army. During his time as a leading officer in Suharto's regime, he's accused of ordering his unit to abduct and torture dozens of democracy activists. He was discharged following this scandal and went into self-imposed exile in Jordan in the 2000s. But he returned to Indonesia a few years later, building up his wealth in various businesses before making the jump to politics. He's had the money and connections to run for president two times before - losing both times to Mr Widodo. But in the last term, Mr Widodo brought him into his cabinet as defence minister - and this is now the closest Mr Prabowo has ever been to the top job. His running mate is Mr Widodo's eldest son Gibran Rakabuming Raka. Though Mr Widodo has not appeared at Mr Prabowo's campaign events, he is seen as having tacitly endorsed the Prabowo-Gibran ticket. A possible victory for Mr Prabowo is a frightening concept for freedom fighters. They fear a Suharto-era general back at the helm of Indonesian government will drag the country back into a dark period. From languishing at the bottom of opinion surveys, Anies Baswedan is now polling second after he criticised Jokowi's plan to move the capital from Jakarta to a new city that is being built on Borneo island. The former Jakarta governor instead favours the development of existing cities to boost equitable growth instead of developing a new capital from scratch. Mr Anies, 54, has portrayed himself as the alternative to the two other candidates who are expected to continue most of Mr Widodo's policies if elected. He has repeatedly claimed democracy has declined under Mr Widodo and pledged to be "consistent in keeping the country away from the practices of feudalism and nepotism". Mr Anies and his running mate Muhaimin Iskandar will be contesting this year's elections under the banner of the Islamic-leaning Coalition of Change for Unity. Their narrative for change has received support from conservative Islamic groups in the world's largest Muslim-majority country. The pair has pledged to create 15 million jobs, offer easier access to credit for prospective home buyers and to upgrade infrastructure in Indonesia's second-tier cities, if elected. Born into a family of academics, Mr Anies spent the earlier years of his career lecturing economics at Paramadina University, before entering politics in 2013, He was appointed education and culture minister after Mr Widodo's first victory but he has been more vocal in criticising the president after being removed in a cabinet reshuffle. In 2017, he won the election to become Jakarta's governor in a divisive vote that exposed religious and ethnic tensions in the Indonesian capital. His tenure saw a push for urban infrastructure in the city, but some feel he has not done enough to address perennial issues like air pollution and traffic congestion. The governor of one of Indonesia's largest provinces presents himself as a humble man of the people. There's no political dynasty or family wealth behind his rise - only a skill to connect with people on a populist agenda: it's won him two terms in Central Java. But he's facing long odds in the national election without the backing of the enormously popular Mr Widodo - who was himself backed by the PDI-P for the last two elections. In the early days of the campaign, he was seen as Mr Widodo's shoo-in successor and analysts had him pegged as the frontrunner. But Mr Widodo has since distanced himself from his party's campaign. Mr Ganjar has been left to rely on his populist appeal and grassroots campaign- selling policies such as millions of jobs, social welfare expansion and making university more accessible. His campaign trail has focused on poorer areas across Indonesia's islands - starting in Papua in the far east and moving across the archipelago, staying in humble villagers' homes. The silver-haired politician had been riding high as governor until he expressed opposition to Israel's participation in the Under-20 Fifa World Cup which was to be held in his province. Fifa then announced it was pulling the tournament from the country - prompting a backlash from football fans against Mr Ganjar. His running mate is Mohammad Mahfud, Indonesia's former security minister, who was also a former chief justice of the Constitutional Court.

             This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Raneisha Stassin, a 31-year-old freelance public relations communications consultant and podcast host based in California. It's been edited for length and clarity. Growing up, I was always forced to go to church. In fact, I grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas, a red state surrounded, by very religious people — many Southern Baptist. I found that if you didn’t go to church and if you were queer or a person of color, Arkansas wasn’t the friendliest place. My mom and all the biological relatives I grew up with were born and raised in Arkansas as well. Many of us, however, were desperate to move out for better job opportunities and to grow our careers. After college, in 2017, I moved to San Francisco. Having lived in both the Bay Area and now San Diego, where I’ve resided for four years now, I can say California has given me greater job opportunities and a better quality of living than Arkansas. In Arkansas, I've experienced a lot of very rural areas that aren’t welcoming to outsiders. The more populous places, like the capital Little Rock, are seen as a lot more diverse. There are typically better job opportunities there too, but those opportunities were very limited for me. While in college, I tried applying for local jobs to gain experience and never heard back — I could only get fast-food work. I received my first public relations internship in Arkansas, during my junior year, only because my professor referred me to some friends of his who had a boutique PR communications agency. I found that in Arkansas most jobs would only hire me if someone they knew vouched for me — most people seemed to get their jobs through a friend of a friend. I think the small-town mindset of sticking to who you know had a lot to do with this. I attended college in Arkansas, but my closest friends were from Northern California. They were much more accepting and suggested I move there. I ended up getting a very competitive public relations internship in San Francisco at Ketchum, a global PR firm. Following that internship, I received my first job offer at a small PR tech agency. After learning the ropes of the industry, I was eventually able to start freelancing and choosing my own clients. In San Francisco, people of varying demographics and backgrounds actively engage with one another. In Arkansas, even in Little Rock, it felt more segregated. As a neurodivergent queer Black woman, it was especially awful for me. People often stuck with those very similar to themselves. For example, even though I lived in Little Rock, I had to be bused to a school in a small town with less diversity because they needed to reach a racial quota. I was called every slur imaginable. At the time that I moved to San Francisco, I was in an interracial marriage and had a biracial neurodivergent son. California felt much more welcoming to my family. It's been a great environment for me to raise my son and there are always a ton of art and culture events. There's so much about Black history I hadn’t learned growing up in Arkansas that I only became aware of after moving here. The opportunities to connect and network with people from all over is another plus that has helped me professionally, allowing me to build my freelance clientele. In the Bay Area and San Diego, I really like that I can just pack up and drive 20 minutes to the beach or go to an art show. The amount of entertainment is greater. I also really love how much more involved Californians are with local politics. Lack of interest in state politics was a huge issue in my home state, leaving people uninformed. I feel most Californians are more educated and aware of politics on a state level and are actively involved in improving circumstances within their communities. Also, when I moved to California, I found a lot of resources for children with autism. My son has autism and has an individualized education plan here. I've found that the schools are always able to point us to additional community resources like regional centers and YMCAs. There are also resources for mental health support, neurodivergent folks, queer folks, and women of color. I'm sure Arkansas also has these resources, but I love how much more accessible they are where I currently live. In Arkansas, many resources were concentrated in Little Rock. When I lived outside Little Rock, I remember driving over 40 miles to go to the doctor because the better doctors for my health conditions were based there. When I separated from my son’s father he had joined the Navy and wanted to co-parent despite being stationed in San Diego. It worked out, though, because moving to San Diego proved more cost-effective than the Bay Area. I was living in a one-bedroom apartment with my son for $3,100 before moving to San Diego, and I still had an hour’s commute to work. Many of the major cities in California are commuter cities and it’s difficult to navigate for someone like me coming from a rural state that typically had one main road. I still need a GPS to get around. Driving in this state is the second biggest con after the high costs. I chose what was right for me and my family, and I encourage others to do what’s right for them. I know I would’ve regretted it had I stayed in Arkansas and tried to assimilate into a lifestyle and culture that wasn’t right for me. Just because you grow up somewhere doesn’t make it home. After I left, I noticed things were improving slowly in Arkansas as more people from different states started to settle there, particularly in college towns. Yet, it’s still a very rural and conservative state, and I was quite used to being “othered” growing up there. Want to share your relocation story? Email Manseen Logan at mlogan@businessinsider.com.

        <div class="headline">There's 'no chance' China's property market rebounds to what it was, researcher says</div>
        <div class="source">businessinsider.com - <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-economy-crash-real-estate-collapse-property-market-rebound-evergrande-2024-2" target="_blank">Read More</a></div>
        

        <div class="preview">
             Back in 2021, China's real estate sector went topsy-turvy — and according to one researcher, it's never going to go back to its halcyon days. "The property market contributes about 10% of China's GDP," Anna Ashton from the Eurasia Group told Bloomberg. "There's not really any sector that can fill in that gap, and there's no chance of the property market rebounding to what it was before." In its heyday, China's real estate sector contributed anywhere from 25% to 30% of the country's GDP. Then real estate behemoth Evergrande defaulted on its debt, tipping the dominoes for a prolonged financial mess. Economic growth has struggled to bounce back after the pandemic, the stock market has tanked, and foreign investors are fleeing. Western countries like the US have also been decoupling from Beijing, and the effects can be seen in the weak hiring in the manufacturing sector, Ashton said. Weak hiring leads to weak wage growth, which leads to weak consumer demand, Ashton explained. But that's only a part of the picture. "It's bigger than just the lack of demand from developed markets that normally would be spending more on Chinese imports," Ashton said, citing weakness in the services and construction sectors as well. Beyond its real estate woes, politics also has a role to play in the economic malaise. "There's this continued tension between emphasizing national security and emphasizing economic growth that creates confusion for businesses," Ashton said. "And it's also helping the continuing weak consumer demand." Just last month, China's crackdown on the video gaming industry sent stocks into a tailspin. Companies like Tencent, NetEase, and BiliBili, a video-sharing site popular with gamers, lost over $80 billion in market value on the same day, spurring a hasty patch-up measure from the government. And China now has another headache to deal with: deflation. In its fourth month of decline, consumer prices have fallen at the fastest pace since 2009, with the latest CPI print dropping 0.8% in January. Read next Jump to

            Front page layout Site theme Ashley Belanger<br> - Feb 16, 2024 9:32 pm UTC Lax content moderation on X (aka Twitter) has disrupted coordinated efforts between social media companies and law enforcement to tamp down on "propaganda accounts controlled by foreign entities aiming to influence US politics," The Washington Post reported. Now propaganda is "flourishing" on X, The Post said, while other social media companies are stuck in endless cycles, watching some of the propaganda that they block proliferate on X, then inevitably spread back to their platforms. Meta, Google, and then-Twitter began coordinating takedown efforts with law enforcement and disinformation researchers after Russian-backed influence campaigns manipulated their platforms in hopes of swaying the 2016 US presidential election. The next year, all three companies promised Congress to work tirelessly to stop Russian-backed propaganda from spreading on their platforms. The companies created explicit election misinformation policies and began meeting biweekly to compare notes on propaganda networks each platform uncovered, according to The Post's interviews with anonymous sources who participated in these meetings. However, after Elon Musk purchased Twitter and rebranded the company as X, his company withdrew from the alliance in May 2023. Sources told The Post that the last X meeting attendee was Irish intelligence expert Aaron Rodericks—who was allegedly disciplined for liking an X post calling Musk "a dipshit." Rodericks was subsequently laid off when Musk dismissed the entire election integrity team last September, and after that, X apparently ditched the biweekly meeting entirely and "just kind of disappeared," a source told The Post. In 2023, for example, Meta flagged 150 "artificial influence accounts" identified on its platform, of which "136 were still present on X as of Thursday evening," according to The Post's analysis. X's seeming oversight extends to all but eight of the 123 "deceptive China-based campaigns" connected to accounts that Meta flagged last May, August, and December, The Post reported. The Post's report also provided an exclusive analysis from the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO), which found that 86 propaganda accounts that Meta flagged last November "are still active on X." The majority of these accounts—81—were China-based accounts posing as Americans, SIO reported. These accounts frequently ripped photos from Americans' LinkedIn profiles, then changed the real Americans' names while posting about both China and US politics, as well as people often trending on X, such as Musk and Joe Biden. Meta has warned that China-based influence campaigns are "multiplying," The Post noted, while X's standards remain seemingly too relaxed. Even accounts linked to criminal investigations remain active on X. One "account that is accused of being run by the Chinese Ministry of Public Security," The Post reported, remains on X despite its posts being cited by US prosecutors in a criminal complaint. Prosecutors connected that account to "dozens" of X accounts attempting to "shape public perceptions" about the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and other world leaders. The accounts also comment on hot-button topics like the fentanyl problem or police brutality, seemingly to convey "a sense of dismay over the state of America without any clear partisan bent," Elise Thomas, an analyst for a London nonprofit called the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told The Post. Some X accounts flagged by The Post had more than 1 million followers. Five have paid X for verification, suggesting that their disinformation campaigns—targeting hashtags to confound discourse on US politics—are seemingly being boosted by X. SIO technical research manager Renée DiResta criticized X's decision to stop coordinating with other platforms. “The presence of these accounts reinforces the fact that state actors continue to try to influence US politics by masquerading as media and fellow Americans," DiResta told The Post. "Ahead of the 2022 midterms, researchers and platform integrity teams were collaborating to disrupt foreign influence efforts. That collaboration seems to have ground to a halt, Twitter does not seem to be addressing even networks identified by its peers, and that’s not great.” Musk shut down X's election integrity team because he claimed that the team was actually "undermining" election integrity. But analysts are bracing for floods of misinformation to sway 2024 elections, as some major platforms have removed election misinformation policies just as rapid advances in AI technologies have made misinformation spread via text, images, audio, and video harder for the average person to detect. In one prominent example, a fake robocaller relied on AI voice technology to pose as Biden to tell Democrats not to vote. That incident seemingly pushed the Federal Trade Commission on Thursday to propose penalizing AI impersonation. It seems apparent that propaganda accounts from foreign entities on X will use every tool available to get eyes on their content, perhaps expecting Musk's platform to be the slowest to police them. According to The Post, some of the X accounts spreading propaganda are using what appears to be AI-generated images of Biden and Donald Trump to garner tens of thousands of views on posts. It's possible that X will start tightening up on content moderation as elections draw closer. Yesterday, X joined Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, TikTok, and other Big Tech companies in signing an agreement to fight "deceptive use of AI" during 2024 elections. Among the top goals identified in the "AI Elections accord" are identifying where propaganda originates, detecting how propaganda spreads across platforms, and "undertaking collective efforts to evaluate and learn from the experiences and outcomes of dealing" with propaganda.

Makena Kelly For a man who claims to be written-off and censored by the mainstream media, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign for president has thrived online. In recent months, Kennedy has suddenly been everywhere. On Instagram, a video of him snorkeling off the shores of Hawaii with a shark advocate and environmental influencer was shared to the influencer’s 1.9 million followers. He talked about “healing America” with celebrity life coach Tony Robbins. Kennedy has appeared on dozens of podcasts, chatting with everyone from comedian and America’s Got Talent judge Howie Mandel to Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Kennedy clips these interviews and pushes them on his own platforms: On TikTok, Kennedy’s videos have received 9 million likes and regularly receive more than a million views. Though Kennedy was banned from Instagram for a few years because he spread Covid vaccine misinformation, he was reinstated in June 2023 and now has over 1.6 million followers—double the number he had when banned. Kennedy cavorts with celebrities and Silicon Valley billionaires, and his aggressive approach to content creators has targeted influencers both big and small to reach important electoral demographics. “He is the podcast candidate,” says Mike Rothschild, an author who writes about conspiracy theories. “Vivek Ramaswamy was someone in the GOP who had some of that, but RFK Jr. is the podcast, Substack, terminally online candidate.” In short, the internet has become Kennedy’s campaign headquarters, where likes and shares have replaced the retail politics of more traditional opponents like President Joe Biden. And Kennedy’s digital determination may well make a big difference: According to some experts, he could disrupt the 2024 election. While the election field has seemingly narrowed to yet another duel between Biden and former president Donald Trump, Kennedy’s conspiracy-focused populist pitch and powerful family name have tapped a rich vein of influence across both Hollywood and the internet, building a vast network of aggrieved supporters prepared to back him through election day. Last April, Kennedy announced his campaign in a nearly two-hour-long speech condemning the mainstream media, the government, and numerous other institutions like the pharmaceutical industry. “This is what happens when you censor somebody for 18 years,” he said. “I got a lot to talk about.” Though Kennedy originally built a career as a top environmental lawyer who played an outsize role in cleaning New York’s Hudson River, he has spent years stoking fear over unfounded claims that vaccines may cause autism in children. By 2020, this skepticism started to include the Covid-19 pandemic. In a roundtable conversation after announcing his campaign, Kennedy falsely claimed that vaccines caused the 1918 flu. Weeks before Covid vaccines became available widely in the US, Facebook (now Meta) suspended Kennedy’s Instagram for sharing debunked claims related to the virus and vaccines. In June, Kennedy sat for a three-hour interview with Joe Rogan on his podcast. The pair discussed Kennedy’s personal history at length, as well as his longtime vaccine skepticism and the debunked conspiracy theory that Wi-Fi and 5G could cause cancer, autism, and what Kennedy called “leaky brain.” Lauren Goode Lauren Goode Matt Burgess Angela Watercutter “I think it degrades your mitochondria, and it opens your blood-brain barrier,” he said. After the podcast was published, Spotify received criticism from vaccine scientists like Peter Hotez and from numerous news outlets for hosting Rogan in the first place. His dangerous vaccine conspiracies were a precursor to other claims about the state of media coverage. Speaking in West Virginia in January, Kennedy bemoaned how his campaign was doing poorly at reaching baby boomers. “They only get their news from ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, and The New York Times,” Kennedy said. “If you’re young and you have parents, you need to lock them up and make them listen to a Joe Rogan podcast.” Kennedy’s digital assault is his only chance at name recognition, let alone the presidency. He’s embraced by people on both the far left and far right, opening up media opportunities across the online political spectrum. Being shut out from the mainstream media, he has become a digital martyr, earning him the sympathies of the aggrieved and “censored” political class who welcome him on their shows and platforms. Kennedy isn’t the first presidential candidate to experiment with more alternative social mediums: Ahead of the 2020 Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang also sat for interviews with Rogan. After Sanders’ August 2019 appearance, Jeff Weaver, then a senior adviser to the campaign, told reporters that the show was an opportunity “to reach a broader audience” and that Sanders was “much more comfortable in formats that allow a more free flow and longform answers.” The Kennedy name is one of the most familiar in American political history, and he has leveraged it to provide legitimacy to both his campaign and the antiestablishment message he pushes online. “The Kennedy name was almost turned into something else,” says Rothschild. “It’s like he’s got that sort of glow of having been wronged by the deep state.” Kennedy’s proclivity toward disruption has also garnered the attention of some of the most wealthy, and reactionary, tech entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. Shortly after his Rogan appearance, billionaire investor Bill Ackman and venture capitalist David Sacks donated to his campaign. Sacks also moderated a rambling conversation with Kennedy and Elon Musk in a Twitter Space last June where Kennedy spent a majority of the time praising Musk for “rescuing democracy and freedom of speech” by purchasing the platform. Many of these venture capitalists, like Sacks, have sizable online audiences of their own, blasting notifications for their followers to join these live chat shows when they start. Kennedy’s celebrity friends have become financial boons for his campaign as well. Clueless star Alicia Silverstone endorsed Kennedy right out of the gate last summer, writing on Instagram that he gives her “hope.” In September, Eric Clapton, musician and anti-vaxxer himself, played a Los Angeles fundraiser for Kennedy that raised $1 million for his campaign and another $1.2 million for the pro-Kennedy American Values 2024 super PAC. In January at Kennedy’s 70th birthday gala in West Hollywood, comedian Theo Von and Kennedy’s wife and Curb Your Enthusiasm star Cheryl Hines spoke—and the PAC raised $5.8 million. On Wednesday, Kennedy’s campaign advertised an online auction on Instagram, accepting bids for “virtual coffee” meetings with Hines and tickets to a pro-Kennedy comedy show for later this month featuring Tim Dillon, Rob Schneider, and Bobby Lee priced at $150, $1,000, and $1,500. At least one of Kennedy’s campaign trail outfits was styled by Tom Soluri, a professional costumer who also worked on a Golden Bachelor promotional campaign. Lauren Goode Lauren Goode Matt Burgess Angela Watercutter But none of these celebrity endorsements and events would matter if they weren’t expertly photographed and packaged for social media pushes. In campaign emails to supporters, the Kennedy campaign asks for “likes, comments, and shares” on these Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube videos for “maximum exposure,” on top of encouraging supporters to donate to his campaign. Last week, the Kennedy team sent out an email blast asking for engagement on a YouTube Short asking for donations. The support Kennedy has received from mega-famous celebrities and billionaires has become one of the campaign’s most powerful marketing strategies, but it’s not the only way they’ve worked to reach voters: The American Values 2024 PAC has started blasting the candidate’s message through networks of influencers with far smaller followings than Rogan or Clapton. According to Federal Election Commission filings, last month the super PAC paid Creator and Company, a content creation and influencer management company, around $150,000 for video production and advertising. Around the same time these payments were made, the PAC launched a social media challenge called #AmericaMoves24, encouraging people to post videos showing how they fit 24 minutes of exercise into their daily lives. Some posts, like from fitness creator Margaux Celeste Alvarez, tag Kennedy and the PAC’s accounts. “I love the #AmericaMoves challenge that @robertfkennedyjr, Kennedy Wellness & @americanvalues 2024 is spearheading: to be active and move for 24 minutes a day,” Alvarez wrote on Instagram last week. “You can get it however you want.” On Monday, American Values 2024 confirmed that the $150,000 payment was related to the #AmericaMoves challenge, telling WIRED that the goal of the social media campaign was “to appeal to younger voters and fitness enthusiasts.” Another post, from fitness influencer Chandler Junk, doesn’t directly mention the campaign or super PAC at all. Junk’s video encourages his audience to go to the PAC’s website to sign up for “a chance to win a custom home gym valued up to $25,000.” The prize offering appears to be an attempt at gathering the names and emails of fitness hobbyists. “We’ve seen similar usage of influencers by political candidates that have a relationship to either the celebrity world or the business world,” says Samuel Woolley, the director of propaganda research at the University of Texas at Austin’s Center for Media Engagement. “It’s a way of getting a candidate’s name out there and building rapport through a means other than politics and divisive issues like abortion or for Kennedy, vaccination.” While some creators participating in the America Moves challenge have followings around 1 million in size, others have much smaller audiences of under 10,000 followers. Since the 2020 presidential election, campaigns and political groups have begun investing in content collaborations with nano and micro influencers to target more niche demographics in hotbed states like Arizona and Georgia. In 2022, the Democratic super PAC American Bridge spent hundreds of thousands on an influencer campaign to support Democrats in the midterm elections. “The reason why campaigns use these micro and nano influencers a lot of the time is because those people are seen to have more authentic relationships with particular demographics,” Woolley told WIRED. “The influencers are seen as a natural conduit to those spaces.” Lauren Goode Lauren Goode Matt Burgess Angela Watercutter It can be difficult to parse how much money a campaign or political groups spend on influencer marketing because these payments are often obscured with opaque language like “digital consulting” in FEC records. In 2020, the Trump campaign spent more than $1 million for “online advertising” to an influencer marketing company owned by a former Trump administration adviser. Just last month, the pro-Biden super PAC Priorities USA spent around $1 million for its own influencer campaign. But for Kennedy, he’s already able to reach huge audiences through his podcast interviews and posts with celebrities that other campaigns may try to buy. And Kennedy has nailed the celebrity-to-influencer to internet pipeline: His social outputs don’t even appear to be advertising merely his campaign, but him as a person. Last year, American Values appeared to make its first attempt at reaching hyper-targeted demographics online. According to FEC records, the PAC spent around $1,500 in November to the music news site, AllHipHop, for “social media” dissemination. The filing shows that the media obligation was to take place on October 25. That same day, the AllHipHop Instagram account shared a video of Beanie Sigel, one of the first rappers signed to Jay-Z’s Roc-a-Fella records, endorsing Kennedy’s campaign. The post does not disclose whether it was paid by the super PAC. AllHipHop did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED, but the PAC said that it did not pay for Sigel’s endorsement and “only paid to boost” it on AllHipHop’s Instagram account. Many of Kennedy’s non-celeb supporters have also become megaphones for the campaign’s content themselves. Last summer, members of the r/RFKJrForPresident subreddit launched a Discord server to distribute “content that the mainstream media is ignoring about Bobby Kennedy,” writing in a post that “a search for positive Kennedy content returns no results.” As of publication, the Independents for Kennedy server has just under 800 users, hosting channels that post every piece of content the Kennedy publishes on all of his social media platforms under a section called “Content for Distribution.” As an Independent candidate, Kennedy doesn’t need to defeat either Biden or Trump in a primary race, but he faces an even steeper uphill battle to get on the general election ballots. The requirements for Independent candidates to gain ballot access varies across states, making it difficult for anyone outside of the Democratic and Republican parties to run a promising general election campaign. Kennedy’s team is reportedly struggling to find all the signatures necessary to get on state ballots and has considered launching its own “We the People” party or linking arms with the Libertarian party to prop up his chances. At the top of the Kennedy campaign website is a banner calling for volunteers to gather all of the signatures it needs to gain ballot access in every state across the country. Time will tell whether its vast online support network is willing to knock on doors to meet these requirements and push Kennedy through to election day. But getting Kennedy on the ballot in just a few states, especially battleground states like Pennsylvania, could still cause a problem for both Biden and Trump even if he doesn’t have a clear path to victory in November. Lauren Goode Lauren Goode Matt Burgess Angela Watercutter “I do think he has a smart strategy, because he’s really trying very hard to get on ballots in what are perceived swing states, and that’s important,” says Melissa M. Smith, an author and communications and journalism professor at Mississippi University for Women. “If he can be, for instance, on the ballot in Georgia or on the ballot in Arizona, and he could pull enough votes, then he might potentially make a difference in those individual states … If you can be on those ballots, then you can potentially be a lot more disruptive.” Recent polls have shown that neither Biden nor Trump are exciting choices for voters, and some experts have suggested that even a few thousand disenchanted Kennedy voters could sway the election in either direction. Republican opponents, like Ron DeSantis, tried to peel off Trump supporters by criticizing the former president’s pandemic-era lockdowns. Since DeSantis has dropped out of the race, Kennedy could rope those voters into his base. “If 10,000 disillusioned Republicans vote for RFK because they’ve listened to so much InfoWars that they think the vaccine is going to kill them in a year, that could be enough for Biden to pick off a couple of states,” Rothschild said. “I think that is very much in play right now.” Other experts, like Matt Bennett, executive vice president of public affairs at the center-left think tank Third Way, say that Biden has just as much to fear of Kennedy as Trump. “If he stays in this to the end, even if he’s on the ballot in 50 states, which is unlikely, this will distill down to a smaller percentage of voters, and we don’t know who they are,” Bennett said. “They might be young men who follow fitness influencers and maybe that hurts Trump. It’s not clear. Or they might be low-information Democrats who see the name Kennedy and think, ‘Well, that’s good. That’s a safe pair of hands if we don’t want Biden.’” Still, Kennedy likely won’t win in November. This momentum could grind to a halt in the weeks and months to come. But the internet has allowed him to build an entire campaign, pushing his message out from the darker parts of the web and into the social media feeds of average users, and that’s no small feat. 📧 Find the best bargains on quality gear with our Deals newsletter The one internet hack that could save everything Online reviews are being bought and paid for.

            In the rapidly evolving world of data storage and processing, combining efficient cloud storage solutions with advanced AI capabilities presents a transformative approach to handling vast volumes of data. This article demonstrates a practical implementation using MinIO, Langchain and OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model, focusing on summarizing documents stored in MinIO buckets. MinIO is open-source, high-performance object storage that is fully compatible with the Amazon S3 API. Known for its scalability, MinIO is ideal for storing unstructured data such as photos, videos, log files, backups and container images. It’s not just about storage; MinIO also offers features like data replication, lifecycle management and high availability, making it a top choice for modern cloud-native applications. Langchain, a Python-based tool, facilitates the interaction between document loaders and AI models. In our use case, we combine Langchain with OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 model to summarize documents from MinIO buckets. This setup exemplifies how AI can extract essential information from extensive data, simplifying data analysis and interpretation. For additional information and supporting materials related to this article such as notebooks and loaded documents, please visit the MinIO Github repository in the langchain-s3-minio directory. Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have Langchain installed. Install it via pip: This will encapsulate all the required libraries we will be using for our S3 loaders and OpenAI model. Initially, we focus on loading documents using Langchain's S3DirectoryLoader and S3FileLoader. These loaders are responsible for fetching multiple and single documents from specified directories and files in MinIO buckets. Python Langchain Example - S3 File Loader Python Langchain Example - S3 Directory Loader After loading the documents, we use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model (which are included in the Langchain library via ChatOpenAI) to generate summaries. This step illustrates the model's capability to understand and condense the content, providing quick insights from large documents. To access the OpenAI API, you can acquire an API key by visiting the OpenAI platform. Once you have the key, integrate it into the code below, to harness the power of GPT-3.5 for document summarization. Python Langchain Example - Summarizing Documents with OpenAI API Below is the output from running this demo, and is a result of integrating LangChain with OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and MinIO S3 storage; the output has been shortened for demonstrative purposes: Response from OpenAI API This method highlights an interesting way to load documents from S3 storage into an LLM using the Langchain framework to process them, while OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model generates a concise summary and key points of the MinIO_Quickstart.md which is fetched from the play.min.io server. The use of AI to analyze and condense extensive documentation, provides users with a quick and thorough understanding of essential aspects like installation, server configuration, SDKs and other MinIO features. It showcases the capability of AI in extracting and presenting critical information from comprehensive data sources. The integration of MinIO, Langchain and OpenAI offers a compelling toolset for managing large data volumes. While Langchain's S3 loaders, S3DirectoryLoader and S3FileLoader, play an important role in retrieving documents from MinIO buckets, they are solely for loading data into Langchain. These loaders do not perform actions related to uploading data into buckets. For tasks like uploading, modifying or managing bucket policies, the MinIO Python SDK is the appropriate tool. This SDK provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for interacting with MinIO storage, including file uploads, bucket management and more. For additional information, please see Quickstart Guide — MinIO Object Storage for Linux, Python Client API Reference — MinIO Object Storage for Linux. While Langchain streamlines the process of fetching and processing data using AI models, the heavy lifting of data management within the MinIO buckets is dependent on the MinIO Python SDK. This is an important distinction that must be understood by developers and data engineers building efficient, AI-integrated storage solutions. For a thorough understanding of MinIO's capabilities and how to utilize its Python SDK for various storage operations, refer to MinIO's official documentation. By using MinIO object storage as the primary data repository for AI and ML processes, you can simplify your data management pipeline. MinIO excels as a one-stop solution for storing, managing, and retrieving large datasets, which is crucial for effective AI and ML operations. This streamlined approach reduces complexity and overhead, potentially accelerating insights by ensuring swift access to data. For those interested in delving deeper into the integration of MinIO with Langchain to enhance LLM tool-use, the article “Developing Langchain Agents with MinIO SDK for LLM Tool-Use” offers a comprehensive exploration of the subject.

The use of AI to analyze and condense extensive documentation, provides users with a quick and thorough understanding of essential aspects like installation, server configuration, SDKs and other MinIO features. It showcases the capability of AI in extracting and presenting critical information from comprehensive data sources. The integration of MinIO, Langchain and OpenAI offers a compelling toolset for managing large data volumes. While Langchain's S3 loaders, S3DirectoryLoader and S3FileLoader, play an important role in retrieving documents from MinIO buckets, they are solely for loading data into Langchain. These loaders do not perform actions related to uploading data into buckets. For tasks like uploading, modifying or managing bucket policies, the MinIO Python SDK is the appropriate tool. This SDK provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for interacting with MinIO storage, including file uploads, bucket management and more. For additional information, please see Quickstart Guide — MinIO Object Storage for Linux, Python Client API Reference — MinIO Object Storage for Linux. While Langchain streamlines the process of fetching and processing data using AI models, the heavy lifting of data management within the MinIO buckets is dependent on the MinIO Python SDK. This is an important distinction that must be understood by developers and data engineers building efficient, AI-integrated storage solutions. For a thorough understanding of MinIO's capabilities and how to utilize its Python SDK for various storage operations, refer to MinIO's official documentation. By using MinIO object storage as the primary data repository for AI and ML processes, you can simplify your data management pipeline. MinIO excels as a one-stop solution for storing, managing, and retrieving large datasets, which is crucial for effective AI and ML operations. This streamlined approach reduces complexity and overhead, potentially accelerating insights by ensuring swift access to data.

            In the rapidly evolving world of data storage and processing, combining efficient cloud storage solutions with advanced AI capabilities presents a transformative approach to handling vast volumes of data. This article demonstrates a practical implementation using MinIO, Langchain and OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model, focusing on summarizing documents stored in MinIO buckets. MinIO is open-source, high-performance object storage that is fully compatible with the Amazon S3 API. Known for its scalability, MinIO is ideal for storing unstructured data such as photos, videos, log files, backups and container images. It’s not just about storage; MinIO also offers features like data replication, lifecycle management and high availability, making it a top choice for modern cloud-native applications. Langchain, a Python-based tool, facilitates the interaction between document loaders and AI models. In our use case, we combine Langchain with OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 model to summarize documents from MinIO buckets. This setup exemplifies how AI can extract essential information from extensive data, simplifying data analysis and interpretation. For additional information and supporting materials related to this article such as notebooks and loaded documents, please visit the MinIO Github repository in the langchain-s3-minio directory. Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have Langchain installed. Install it via pip: This will encapsulate all the required libraries we will be using for our S3 loaders and OpenAI model. Initially, we focus on loading documents using Langchain's S3DirectoryLoader and S3FileLoader. These loaders are responsible for fetching multiple and single documents from specified directories and files in MinIO buckets. Python Langchain Example - S3 File Loader Python Langchain Example - S3 Directory Loader After loading the documents, we use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model (which are included in the Langchain library via ChatOpenAI) to generate summaries. This step illustrates the model's capability to understand and condense the content, providing quick insights from large documents.

        <div class="preview">
            Kwasi Kwarteng, who served as the U.K.’s finance minister during the mini-budget crisis which saw Britain’s pound drop to its lowest ever levels against the U.S. dollar, has said he will not stand for reelection as a member of parliament. The British politician, who had previously worked for London hedge fund Odey Asset Management before being elected the MP for Skelthorpe in 2010, said that he will not stand in the U.K.’s upcoming general elections, which must be held by Jan. 28 2025 at the latest. Kwarteng, who also worked as a financial analyst at JP Morgan prior to entering politics, was given the job of finance minister by Britain’s shortest serving prime minister, Liz Truss, following her victory in an internal Conservative party vote in September 2022. The vote saw Truss take over from her predecessor, Boris Johnson, following the announcement of his resignation in July 2022, in the midst of a revolt among MPs over his handling of sexual misconduct allegations against Tory MP Chris Pincher. As chancellor, Kwarteng subsequently announced plans to implement a controversial “mini-budget,” which was met with an overwhelmingly negative response, that saw Britain’s sterling plunge to all -time lows. The mini-budget proposed an array of tax cuts that led to concerns among economists the U.K. would be forced to increase borrowing. The International Monetary Fund later called on Britain to “re-evaluate” its plans as it warned the mini-budget would “likely increase inequality.” The prime minister later asked Kwarteng to resign, just 38 days after taking up the post, as she replaced him with current Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt, and reversed parts of the mini budget, in a bid to reassure financial markets. Truss herself became Britain’s shortest ever serving prime minister after resigning just 45 days after taking up office. Kwarteng became the U.K.’s second shortest serving chancellor after ex-Tory minister Iain MacLeod who died 13 days into his tenure, in July 1970. Born to Ghanaian parents in London in 1975, Kwarteng attended Britain’s prestigious Eton College before going on to study classics and history at Trinity College, Cambridge. He later studied at Harvard University as a Kennedy Scholar before returning to Cambridge University to complete a PhD in the economic history of the Great Recoinage Crisis of 1696. Kwarteng separately faced scrutiny after the hedge fund owned by his former boss, Crispin Odey, was revealed to have made huge gains by shorting the pound, just weeks after Odey met the ex-finance minister for lunch. Odey later shut Odey Asset Management, in October 2023, after a Financial Times investigation raised allegations the hedge fund manager had sexually harassed and assaulted 13 women. Kwarteng said he will continue serving as MP for Skelthorpe until the end of his term. MarketWatch contacted Kwarteng’s parliamentary office for comment. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says it’s not “the end of our story” despite Donald Trump’s easy primary victory in South Carolina, her home state where the onetime governor had long suggested her competitiveness with the former president would show.

        <div class="preview">
            To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories Find anything you save across the site in your account By Rebecca Giggs On a fall day in Gainesville, Georgia, Justin Kobylka, the forty-two-year-old owner of Kinova Reptiles, was preparing to cut open two clutches of snake eggs. He was hoping to hit upon some valuable, beautiful reptiles. Kobylka is a breeder of designer ball pythons—one-of-a-kind, captive-bred snakes whose skin features colors and patterns not usually found in nature. “I think of myself as an explorer,” he told me. Nicking an egg with a pair of surgical scissors, he exposed a live hatchling in its goo. “Even when they haven’t yet touched air, you can sometimes see the tongue going,” he said, making a flicking gesture with his thumb and fingertip. We were standing in a six-thousand-square-foot climate-controlled outbuilding that housed some two thousand pythons, which were kept in individual plastic trays slotted into tall metal racks. The space, which cost nearly a million dollars to build and outfit, was immaculate and well lit, with corner-mounted industrial fans and glossy floors. A vague odor of musk and Clorox was all that hinted at the daily chores of snake husbandry. Ball pythons originated in Africa, and in the wild they are typically dark brown with tan patches and a pale underbelly. Those bred for their appearance, as Kobylka’s have been, often have a brighter palette, from soft washes of pastel to candy-colored bursts of near-fluorescence. Their patterns, too, have been transformed: a snake might be tricked out with pointillist dots, or a single dramatic stripe, or colors dissolving into one another, as in tie-dye. One captive-bred ball python’s splotches and squiggles show up only under a black light. These changes reflect genetic mutations, which breeders call morphs. (The term is also used as shorthand for the snakes themselves.) World of Ball Pythons, a repository of information related to breeding, has catalogued more than seven thousand morphs in the past thirty years—though the actual number likely exceeds that by several thousand. “Evolution can go very fast,” the animal-domestication expert and paleobiologist Marcelo Sánchez-Villagra, a professor at the University of Zurich, told me, adding that the variety of “ball pythons may be extreme even among reptiles.” Arguably, no other snake, lizard, or turtle has been so sweepingly restyled by human effort. The animals Kobylka breeds at Kinova are sold to collectors, independent pet stores, and élite breeders who want to replicate, or even improve on, their design. The launch of a new morph is sometimes called a “reveal” or a “drop,” echoing the language of luxury-sneaker culture, and there are ball-python Internet forums that roil with opinion about which morphs are the hottest, and which ones aren’t worth the hype. The most coveted morphs have commanded higher prices than giraffes, lions, and tigers have at auction. “I’ve had offers of over a hundred thousand dollars on a snake,” Kobylka said. “But the way I operate, it’s important to keep those snakes for my future work. You actually lose money long-term if you sell the most amazing thing at the time.” Kobylka, who is six feet two, was wearing a gray Lacoste polo, charcoal-colored jeans, and Adidas Sambas; he has dark hair, which he keeps short. In the first clutch, which had nine eggs, he was aiming, he said, for an “orange dream, yellow belly, enchi, leopard, desert ghost, carrying axanthic and clown genes.” What sounded like an incantation was a catalogue of desirable mutations. (“Clown,” for example, is named for teardrop shapes that show up under the eyes, like the stylized tears of a clown.) As a breeder, Kobylka always has a “goal snake” in mind. “You’ve done a lot of mental work to imagine it, usually years in advance,” he told me, describing a process of zeroing in on specific traits using the known heritability and interaction of genes. “Sometimes your odds are one in two hundred and fifty-six, or one in five hundred and twelve, to make the snake you’re thinking about,” he said. “The thing that makes it so addicting for me is the fact that there’s a large amount of chance involved.” Kobylka has been breeding snakes for more than twenty years and is known as a trendsetter in the field, which is both close-knit and competitive. Courtney Capps, a co-founder of Leviathan Snakes, in South Carolina, observed that buyers are sometimes so proud of owning a Kinova python that, when it comes time to sell its offspring, they’ll note in the listing, “Mom was produced by Justin.” Kobylka gained an even wider audience in 2016, after he opened up an egg to find a white snake patterned with three orange smiley faces along its body. He had been trying to produce a “dreamsicle”—a white ball python with splotches of tangerine—but most of the circular markings on this snake had two eyes and a grin. Kobylka posted an image on his company’s Facebook page, and, when someone suggested in a comment that the photograph had been edited, he made a fifteen-second video that showed him turning the baby python from side to side to display its distinctive motif. The video of the “emoji python” went viral, and the story of the unusual snake was covered by Esquire, Business Insider, and the New York Post, among other outlets. On the day I visited Kinova, Kobylka wasn’t filming the proceedings, but he sometimes shares egg-cutting videos on Patreon and YouTube. Ball pythons are able to hatch on their own, but such videos, in which a breeder gives a preview of a snakelet’s coloration, have garnered a dedicated following. Offering anticipation, disclosure, and irregular reward, they are, in many ways, similar to toy-unboxing sequences. The footage also has elements of the #oddlysatisfying content known as A.S.M.R. (autonomous sensory meridian response)—videos of human hands gently manipulating something slimy or soft, for instance, or holding an object ready to burst. It isn’t just egg cutting; the entire business of ball-python breeding is extremely online. Breeders deliver pro tips via live stream, develop colorways that will “pop” on Instagram, and often use language borrowed from digital-image editing, promising that a mutation will provide “amazing contrast” or “pixelated sides.” Ball-python aficionados can’t seem to get enough, finding in morphs a combination of clickbait, dream collectibles, data-driven hobby, and living art. Recently, a video of a ball python with the mottling of an overripe banana next to an actual banana was posted widely on X, while a TikTok video showing a ball python named Gizmo tracing a serpentine line on a tablet computer, as if on an Etch A Sketch, has been viewed approximately five million times. (“He tried to draw himself,” one commenter noted.) It was balmy in the outbuilding. Kobylka modulates the temperature to stagger the pythons’ breeding cycles throughout the year (wild females become fertile in response to seasonal cues), but his snakes still seem to intuit the weather outside. A rainstorm can spark mating—Kobylka said that he will sometimes rush to match receptive females to males ahead of a downpour. The first clutch, I learned, had a parent with a pastel gene, which, in addition to being commonplace, causes the animal’s coloring to fade over time. (The standard life span of a captive ball python is fifteen to thirty years, though the St. Louis Zoo had one that keepers believe lived to be at least sixty-two.) Pastel unfortunately dominated the brood: most of the snakes would be priced in the low thousands. But, Kobylka said, “every miss is, as probably a gambler would tell you, almost as exciting as a win.” A miss, he explained, will still find a home, and can provide useful information about how traits are masked, or about other polygenic effects. Link copied Things went better with the next clutch. Glistening in the first shell was a tiny ball python with three recessive traits—“desert ghost, g-stripe, clown”—and another mutation called “spotnose.” The baby snake was the color of straw, with smoky markings down its body, as though it had been repeatedly pinched by hot tongs. “That’s everything it could be,” Summer Melville, Kinova’s business manager, said. The hatchling, a male, would retail for fifteen thousand dollars and be posted on MorphMarket, an e-commerce site for reptiles. “My wife says I didn’t get as excited about our kids being born as when the eggs hatch,” Kobylka told me, “but I knew what to expect with our children.” (The Kobylkas have five children: two adopted, three biological.) “Actually,” he added, “our last son came out with red hair and blue eyes, so he was a double recessive.” As Kobylka went around pulling out trays to show me some of his most valuable full-grown pythons, I was reminded that in nature these creatures are ambush predators. Charles Darwin believed that a fear of snakes is, to some degree, hardwired in us. In “The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals” (1872), he recounts putting his face up against the glass enclosure of an adder in an attempt to conquer “the imagination of a danger which had never been experienced.” The adder struck at the barrier. Darwin couldn’t help but leap backward. But ball pythons are not venomous, and were named for their tendency to curl up when threatened. The ones I saw tended to huddle in a corner, or contract slowly toward the farthest edge of their trays, which were lined with shredded coconut husk. They couldn’t hide their extraordinary appearance, though. I saw a sixty-thousand-dollar python of such stark elegance—bone white and ink—that you could imagine it being unveiled at the Venice Biennale, and a bubble-gum-pink python fit for Barbie. Kobylka admitted to getting quite attached to some of them. Star stickers had been placed on several racks to indicate his favorites, encouraging particular devotion from his staff. In the wild, ball pythons are nocturnal and live mostly underground, often in burrows taken over from rodent prey. They are not very social, though infants may stick together for a short time after hatching. Was Kobylka’s affection, then, one-sided? “Ball pythons don’t seem to mind being held, but they don’t seem as curious as some other species,” he said. The team at Kinova would soon box up dozens of the company’s finest specimens and drive them to Tinley Park, Illinois, for the North American Reptile Breeders Conference (N.A.R.B.C.), one of the most anticipated reptile expos in the nation (“the Mecca of the ball-python market,” as one breeder called it). Kobylka, who owns several Porsches, including a 2016 Cayman GT4 Clubsport that he races, compared the N.A.R.B.C. to a premium car show, offering a window onto the future of the industry. A draw for attendees this year would be the opportunity to meet Emily Roberts, the star of Snake Discovery, a YouTube channel with more than three million subscribers. Kobylka himself was teasing the existence of a baby “sunset combo” on YouTube. “We finally hit something really epic,” he announces in the video. Before leaving Kinova, I asked if I could hold a ball python. Kobylka selected a small lemon-yellow snake and placed its rolled-up body on my open palm. I had expected something cool to the touch, but the snake was warm, the temperature of its enclosure. When I shut my eyes, the impression of it on my hand seemed remarkably faint. “They tend to just sit still, and they’re handleable,” Kobylka said. “They’re just so packaged.” The ball python is known to zoologists as Python regius, or “royal python.” Cleopatra is rumored to have worn one as a bracelet, but the story is almost certainly apocryphal—ball pythons have never been native to Egypt. Today, ball pythons live in western Africa and parts of central and eastern Africa, from Senegal to the borderlands of South Sudan and Uganda. About three feet long, they can be found on the margins of rain forests and in the woods, but they have also adapted to managed environments: timber plantations, agricultural fields, trash heaps. Snakes have evolved without major transformation for more than a hundred million years. Ball-python breeding and collecting is a relatively recent phenomenon. The high end of the American reptile market was long monopolized by large, heavy-bodied snakes, like boas and reticulated pythons. In the early twentieth century, dealers mainly sold their wares to film studios and zoos. By the mid-nineteen-sixties, improved habitat construction in zoos led to snowballing competition for hard-to-collect species—Angolan pythons plucked from war zones along the Namibia-Angola border, iridescent Boelen’s pythons caught on the mountainsides of Papua New Guinea. The consumer market for pet reptiles was sluggish by comparison; through the nineteen-eighties, wildlife traders viewed parrots as more profitable. The investigative journalist Bryan Christy has described reptiles as having been “the Bic lighters of the pet industry: cheap, disposable point-of-sale pets.” Link copied In the early nineteen-nineties, though, household reptiles began to get a reputational makeover. Children raised on “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Jurassic Park” reimagined scaly pets as characterful and intriguing. Retailers started to see an uptick in iguana sales. New Caledonian crested geckos, believed extinct until 1994 and jeopardized today by wildfires and invasive predators, became well established in captivity. Snakes were pitched to prospective buyers as perfect for cramped urban residences: undemanding, hypoallergenic, and needing to be fed only once a week. Ball pythons—which were abundant in their natural habitats and, being compact and docile, highly transportable—were soon arriving in the U.S. by the crateful, tucked into sacks and pillowcases. Between 1989 and 1999, exports of ball pythons from West Africa to the United States tripled. In “The Ultimate Ball Python,” an encyclopedic volume on morphs helmed by the breeder Kevin McCurley, one early broker described them as a “junk” species. In pet stores across the U.S., imported brown-and-tan ball pythons sold for around thirty dollars, discounted for being less alluring than other tropical reptiles. They were quintessential starter pets, and when he was in his mid-twenties McCurley, now an exuberant figure in the snake world, owned two: Eek and Meek. Speaking to me from what he called a “venomous room” in his breeding complex in New Hampshire, McCurley said that one day he had a vision of what ball pythons could be: “I looked at the vehicle of the ball python, and I said, ‘This is the ideal snake. But it needs a totally different paint job.’ ” In 1989, an Oklahoma-based breeder named Bob Clark received a tip about a single albino ball python found in Africa. “I got a letter from a friend in The Hague, Netherlands, about a dealer in Ghana, who had the animal,” he told me. For a few years, Clark had been successfully cultivating albino Burmese pythons, costly novelties that can reach almost twenty feet, which he raised on rats, rabbits, and piglets. But in the ball python’s small size he saw an opportunity. On the strength of a photograph sent to him in the mail, he bought the albino for seven thousand dollars, a price that he said “seemed a little crazy” at the time. It took Clark several years of linebreeding—mating snakes to their forebears, littermates, or descendants—to produce a second albino ball python, and more followed. (Such ball pythons aren’t pure white: you might get a snake with carrot-orange daubs or pale-yellow streaks.) He began selling the hatchlings at seventy-five hundred dollars apiece, and a wait list quickly formed. Collectors liked them, but his main type of client, he found, was the aspiring breeder. “Everybody wants nice, beautiful, expensive snakes that are rare,” he said. “One way they justify that to themselves, and their spouse, is to say, ‘This could be a moneymaker.’ ” Then, in 1994, Clark’s facilities were burgled. The thief got away with his founding albino male as well as females that were heterozygous for the trait. Clark retained a large enough colony to continue, but he began hearing rumors of other albino ball pythons: his supply was no longer exclusive. (The thief was eventually caught and ordered to pay a civil judgment of $2.5 million.) Soon another ball-python type, the piebald, or pied, which features mottled brown spots on an ivory body and is considered scarce in the wild, became popular: in 1997, a pied ball python could sell for thirty thousand dollars. McCurley, who had been breeding reptiles while working a day job as an electronic technician, couldn’t afford an albino, let alone a pied. Instead, he started buying imports with minor irregularities, and mating them to determine whether a specific quirk could be passed on (a process known to breeders as “proving out”). Most anomalies were discreet—a bit of speckling, a squiggle along a spine. Matthew Lerer, who used to sort reptile shipments in South Florida, noted in “The Ultimate Ball Python” that McCurley would study the snakes’ markings for hours, “like he was a gemologist inspecting the Hope Diamond.” Mike Wilbanks, a snake breeder from Oklahoma, told me, of the years that followed, “Some of the morphs turned into gold mines. Some turned out to be just a dry, empty hole.” It is not possible to trademark a morph, but breeders came to view the particular designs they were working toward as commercially sensitive information. The first to produce a morph, and name it, gained celebrity. Many breeders believe that ball pythons’ history of living primarily belowground has preserved an array of mutations related to appearance. The thinking is that eye-catching snakes living aboveground are more visible to predators, making them more liable to be picked off before their genes get passed on. (Ball pythons have poor color vision, and their markings, unlike those of many lizard species, are not thought to play a role in courtship.) By the early two-thousands, middlemen in Ghana, Togo, and Benin had learned that American buyers were willing to spend top dollar for “odd balls”—snakes that diverged from the wild type in even minor ways. What had been an amateur pursuit was fast becoming an industry. Ball-python exports from West Africa peaked at around two hundred and fifty thousand a year in 2005, and began to decline, as domestic breeding replaced mass importation. American captive-bred ball pythons seemed to better express buyers’ notion of the exotic. The wild type had begun to be seen, in McCurley’s words, as “garden variety.” Perhaps not unrelatedly, snakes—and snakeskin—were having a moment in the broader culture as emblems of opulence and transgression. At the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, Britney Spears sashayed across the stage with a seven-foot-long Burmese python slung around her shoulders. Gleaming in the windows of high-end fashion boutiques were python-skin footwear and clothes, often dyed traffic-light green, neon yellow, or electric blue, from Yves Saint Laurent, Jimmy Choo, and Chanel. (“Eve’s Revenge, the Python’s Sorrow,” one headline in the Times ran.) Ball pythons were too small to be profitable for the skin trade, but the Zeitgeist’s embrace of surreally hued scales conferred an aura of glamour on collecting and breeding them. Kobylka had an itinerant childhood. His mother—who raised him and his younger brother on her own—sold handicrafts and moved the family to Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado, Tennessee, and Arizona. Wherever he was, Kobylka spent hours outside. “I always felt there’s a world within a spot,” he said. “Lizards and turtles and frogs, centipedes and salamanders—creatures most people would walk right past and never see.” His mother encouraged Kobylka’s pursuits but insisted that no animal be brought home. “That was the rule with my family: what’s wild is wild.” When Kobylka was a teen-ager, he began attending a small religious boarding school in Oklahoma, where he became fascinated by scarlet king snakes, an elusive, tricolored species. After class, he would go searching for them, turning over logs and debris. He didn’t find one, but he did catch a rattlesnake, which he kept in a homemade cage in his dorm room until he himself was caught. “I met my wife at the school, and it was her mom who called and tattled on me,” Kobylka said with a laugh. The school did offer him an empty room to accommodate the rest of his collection, which by then included White’s tree frogs, box turtles, and a red-tailed boa he had bought at a pet store. At nineteen, Kobylka spent a gap year in Benin, where ball pythons pocket the landscape. While there, he visited a Vodun temple and saw ball pythons, which are regarded as sacred, roaming freely. “I have pictures of me from that time, holding ball pythons, having no concept of: this is going to be my whole life,” he said. What captivated him then were chameleons—reptiles that change color for camouflage or to indicate excitation, rivalry, or submission. He gave local children pocket change for any that they could catch, and placed the animals on the boughs of a tree outside his lodgings. He would sometimes climb the tree and be surrounded by the creatures, the shade tick-ticking with eyes. Kobylka attended Southern Adventist University, in Tennessee, where he majored in communications and began keeping king snakes—which are banded and slender—caged in his dorm bathroom; he soon had fourteen of them. He was reintroduced to ball pythons through the Web site of a Maryland-based breeder named Ralph Davis, who kept pieds. “He had this rock-star personality,” Kobylka told me. “Ralph’s site was the only place you could see all these mutations and get a picture of what was possible. Everyone else was stuck in the Stone Age.” On weekends, Kobylka would visit his uncle, a physician in Georgia. “I was just talking about snakes constantly,” Kobylka said. “I drove him crazy.” One day, his uncle offered to invest in a pair of pastel ball pythons, then top-tier morphs, and to split the profits if they produced salable offspring. They earned enough on the deal that Kobylka was able to persuade his uncle to buy a pied, which he went to fetch from a dealer in Florida. “I still remember driving home with that animal,” Kobylka told me. “I would stop by the side of the road to look at it every hour. And I just—” He exhaled, seemingly at a loss for words. “Amazement,” he said after a beat. (These days, ball pythons are sent between dealers and collectors using overnight mail carriers such as FedEx.) His uncle attached one condition to the purchase: the snake was too valuable to be left in Kobylka’s care, so it would live in a tank next to his uncle’s bed. The early two-thousands were a good time to get into the business. McCurley had received a six-figure bid for three golden snakelets with webbing patterns, called “spider” morphs. The breeder Mike Wilbanks sold a “black-eyed Lucy”—a leucistic ball python—to a Belgian collector for two hundred thousand dollars. People were taking on debt to finance their ball-python purchases. “I had second mortgages on my house so I could have a hundred thousand dollars ready to go if that next new thing came out,” Wilbanks told me. “It was a big race.” Like a new gadget, a morph might be faddish and expensive at first, but as it was sold widely its value would slide to an entry-level price point. Those rare ball-python traits first discovered in the wild and now known as base morphs had followed this trajectory. “They all became accessible,” Kobylka said. He recalled thinking, “Wait a minute, there’s infinite possibilities if we just stack genes together.” He told me, “That’s where I got my jump on the industry.” In 2003, he launched his business, aiming for “combos,” mutations layered together, in order to produce singular dazzlers that could appeal to connoisseur breeders in the U.S. and internationally rather than to big-box pet stores. It would be a slow-release undertaking. “I wanted to imagine a morph combo in the future, and create it ten years later—that was what I was all about,” he said. These days, Kinova’s yield is around fifteen hundred pythons a year, and Kobylka is seen as unrivalled in his artistry with genetic mutations, a breeder at the frontiers of the form. “You will never ever be able to catch Justin Kobylka,” Antoine Hood, of High Desert Pythons, in North Carolina, told me. “How can I parallel him? That’s a better endeavor.” Brittney Gobble, who breeds ball pythons in Tennessee, called Kobylka “a savant.” “He’s able to create a 3-D model, combining five or six mutations in his mind. And then eventually it gets made, and it looks like how he described it,” Gobble said. “It’s truly just insane.” On a brisk October day, I went to the North American Reptile Breeders Conference in Tinley Park, where venders from around the country had set up booths. With most transactions taking place online, expos are seen as an opportunity to launch what Kobylka called “really cutting-edge things.” Many breeders showed their ball pythons in clear acrylic boxes on logo-printed paper; photographs of them would be automatically branded. Kobylka had walked around the venue before it opened to the public, taking note of the competition, but now he couldn’t get more than a few steps away from the Kinova booth without being accosted by neophyte breeders and reptile enthusiasts. In the melee, I saw a buyer lightly rap the top of one of Kinova’s display cases and announce, “That’s the snake—that’s the showstopper.” It was the “sunset combo” morph, which had the bittersweet-orange sheen of heirloom glassware. Kobylka held court, fielding queries and dispensing advice. “Justin would take this off my hands in a second, if I let him,” a breeder who had brought a morph called “Cyborg” said. Emily Roberts’s fans had dressed in pink, and together they formed a shuffling, spangled queue. A woman in a sleek blazer was deftly handling a lustrous slate-blue snake, changing her grip the way a rappeller belays a top rope, hand over hand, as the snake cascaded without progress in the direction of the floor. “They can have quite a spicy temperament,” she declared. “They’re not for beginners.” At the booth for Best Dressed Balls—an Iowa-based venture run by a breeder named Troy Schroeder—a girl of nine patted the box in front of her, fixated on the creature inside. “Tell everyone he’s unlovable, Troy,” she pleaded, hoping to save up enough to bring it home. An estimated six million households in the U.S. include at least one reptile. Millennials make up the largest group of reptile owners, but snakes, lizards, and turtles have become increasingly popular with Generation Z. “One of our concerns is that technology will take kids away from this world,” a breeder observed. “Why would a kid today want to peer at a snake through glass, when they can put a V.R. headset on and play with dinosaurs?” As much as the ball python seems to have been pulled into the technological infrastructure of the twenty-first century—featured in live streams, traded via MorphMarket—snake ownership was frequently portrayed at the expo as an antidote to the anomie of feeling ourselves to be part of a big machine. A 2015 poll of readers by Scientific American Mind found that snake owners were more likely than other pet owners to describe their animals as “part of the family.” Some reptile owners clearly felt that more was more. Bob Clark was in the crowd, buzzing from the recent sale of five “retics” (reticulated pythons) to a customer in the Middle East, for half a million dollars. These snakes were so big that, once crated, a forklift had been needed to move them. Among breeders, the matter of snake size could be divisive. “One per cent of snake keepers are up to taking care of a snake that large, and not the other ninety-nine,” Kobylka said. He expressed unease at the rise of social-media accounts that sensationalize living with gigantic snakes, misrepresenting snake keeping as an extreme sport rather than a serious responsibility. But the majority of collectors were there for the ball pythons. Although Python regius is not endangered in Africa, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (I.U.C.N.) has designated it as near-threatened, and the N.A.R.B.C. prohibits animals that aren’t captive-bred or “quality farm-raised” in the U.S. As I wandered through aisle upon aisle of ball pythons, I wondered if the line between the wild type and the captive-bred could be so easily demarcated. Rob Rausch, who is in charge of juvenile animals at Kinova, told me that he thought ball-python morphs took the pressure off wild-snake populations by satisfying people’s longing for exotic-looking reptiles. “You can go to the wild, and you can get a normal ball python. Or you can come here, and”—he made an openhanded gesture, as of a shopkeeper displaying his wares—“What color do you like? What pattern do you like?” At the N.A.R.B.C., combos that were darker in tone reigned. I saw rows of axanthics, which are monochrome, in ash white, pewter, and black. There was a “hurricane” combo, with lightning slashes of electric yellow along its chocolate-brown sides. Then there were the ball pythons that hadn’t yet been conjured. Kobylka told me that he was hoping to make “a truly zebra-looking animal, with black and white stripes.” He added, “We visualize that, but the difficulty is that’d be a quadruple recessive. That’s many years out.” I had already seen, at the expo, designer “leopard” morphs, with the coloration of a spotted big cat, and there were also two much talked-about “gorilla” combos, which were dark with tortoise-shell ripples: as on fashion runways, there was a constant conflation of wildness with luxury. Ball pythons have come to be seen as unnatural, hothouse creatures. At the conference, I frequently heard them described as “pet rocks”—that is to say, inert and highly collectible. “A snake is a snake,” Clark said. “You can’t make a dog out of it.” I appreciated the fact that many breeders seemed to resist anthropomorphizing their stock. But speaking of ball pythons as “pet rocks” seemed to ignore their fundamental creatureliness. “I’ve had people who have had five-thousand-dollar, ten-thousand-dollar snakes, who said they didn’t want to pay seventy-five dollars for an exam or treatment for that animal,” Mark Mitchell, a professor of zoological medicine in Louisiana, said. “People are much more apt to want to take care of an animal they view affectionately than those they consider commodities.” Yet evolving into eye candy for humans has meant that designer ball pythons, when viewed at the species level, enjoy some of the evolutionary advantages of domestic animals, including wide dispersal. “There isn’t a single endangered species of domestic animal,” Marcelo Sánchez-Villagra told me. “Many have worldwide distribution.” With natural habitats disappearing all the time, finding a way to shelter within anthropic culture might be a good strategy. “What is a better ticket to survival than being beautiful and rare?” Clark said. “Those traits are going to be multiplied in future generations because that’s what people like, not because that’s what kept you from getting eaten.” The evolutionary trade-offs borne by individual snakes in captivity, however, have, in some instances, been dire. Breeders once championed their field as a salve against the cruelties of shipping wild-foraged snakes, which can be at risk for dehydration, parasites, and increased disease transmission, but morphs aren’t always better off. Over time, breeders have discovered that several sought-after traits and specific gene-crossings also produce physical irregularities. Duckbill, in which a snake’s rostrum is upturned and flattened, is a benign deformity, but it is said that some morphs, such as the “caramel albino,” have a higher chance of producing young with spine kinks, a condition that can prevent them from moving sinuously, or can fatally obstruct digestion. “If we hatch a python with small eyes, we won’t sell it as a breeder,” Courtney Capps told me. “We sell those as pets only, because I don’t want the genetics to be passed on. Potentially, at some point, small eyes turn into no eyes.” Another condition that can be distressing is “wobblehead,” a tic that likely betrays neurological issues. Online, breeders have counselled against pairing morphs that are known to result in impairments. (“We want mutations that are just skin-deep,” Kobylka told me. “We don’t want the animal to be at all changed in any way that would hurt its ability to survive.”) But some unusual malformations, unrelated to breeding morphs, can be profitable windfalls: early in the new year, Clark sold a two-headed ball python for a hundred thousand dollars. “Both heads eat,” he assured me, when I inquired after its health. At Kinova, I had asked Kobylka which was the rarest snake in the room, expecting to be shown something supremely expensive. As it turned out, though, the rarest snake was an endling, the last of its kind, and wouldn’t be sold. He retrieved it from a tray. The morph was called “desert,” a snake the color of burnt butter with a toothlike pattern. It was a variety that “everybody loved when it first came out,” he said, “but, if you try to breed them, the eggs will get stuck and they’ll die.” Unsurprisingly, many snake experts are skeptical of the whole morph-making enterprise. “It’s ‘The Island of Doctor Moreau,’ ” the British herpetologist Neil D’Cruze told me. D’Cruze is the head of research at World Animal Protection International, and the senior co-author of “Snakes and Ladders,” a scientific paper on the ball-python trade, published in 2020. “The speed-breeding, the genetic manipulation, it’s being pushed out of the desire to create a new product. Not to help the snake cope better in captivity—to be a better pet for whoever owns it. Are these animals part of a genuine conservation program to help save the species? No.” Some are concerned about the limits of our ability to envision what snakes need, and to act in their best interests. Eben Kirksey, an Oxford professor of anthropology who has written about python-breeding communities in the U.S., believes that seeing “past the dollar value of a snake with particularly colorful skin” would mean offering more to the snakes than racking trays. Breeders “talk about burrowing,” Kirksey said, “but the enclosures I’ve seen, they’re not like actual burrows. These are life-support technologies that people are cobbling together out of plastic, out of machines.” Were the snakes O.K. with all of this? “There are a lot of animals that, unfortunately for them, tolerate captivity well,” D’Cruze told me. “But suffering isn’t always overt. Suffering can be under the hood, invisible.” I had read that it was possible to gauge a python’s stress by measuring its blood cortisol, but as I walked around the expo I found myself troubled by the question of what thriving or discomfort looked like in a snake. Could a python raised in a tray, fed, kept warm and watered, and bred be said to live a full life? In the meantime, the business of breeding rolls ever forward. When ball pythons were first becoming investment pieces, inevitably there were scams. One individual purported to have the world’s first entirely red ball python, and sold the python’s offspring—which were all black—to several U.S. concerns. As clutches laid by those snakes failed to contain any crimson hatchlings, vexed breeders agreed that they’d been conned. New technology promises to change all of that. A topic of fervent conversation at the expo was shed-testing, a kind of 23andMe for snakes, as Kobylka put it. “That’s where our industry is headed,” he said. The testing, which requires the tiniest scrap of molted snakeskin, offers designers a more rigorous way to verify traits. Brittney Gobble told me she had heard that artificial insemination might soon be available for ball pythons, which would expand the field exponentially. I imagined a world where creating new morphs would be a matter of transporting little vials of snake sperm, not the snakes themselves. In one of our earliest conversations, Kobylka had said that he wanted “to make something that is genuinely beautiful to an average person. That’s my criteria—if the person on the street, who doesn’t like snakes, stops and says, like, ‘Whoa, that’s a snake?! I didn’t know a snake could look like that.’ ” But it was also possible to go too far. A scaleless morph, for example, has bald, matte skin, similar to a sphynx cat or a furless guinea pig. Many will recognize it as “the pinnacle of ‘unnatural,’ ” the veterinarian H. Kitt Hollister wrote in “The Ultimate Ball Python,” because it is “delicate, and seemingly unable to survive without human intervention.” The breeder responsible for the morph, Brian Barczyk, who died earlier this year, of pancreatic cancer, marketed it as “smooth and soft,” a completely different texture to touch. Kobylka told me that when he finally got to hold one he was perturbed. The scaleless snake seemed to break the boundaries of what a snake is. “They feel like human skin,” he said, shuddering at the memory. ♦ A reporter’s relationship with Kurt Cobain, before and after the singer’s death.

            To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories Find anything you save across the site in your account By Rebecca Giggs On a fall day in Gainesville, Georgia, Justin Kobylka, the forty-two-year-old owner of Kinova Reptiles, was preparing to cut open two clutches of snake eggs. He was hoping to hit upon some valuable, beautiful reptiles. Kobylka is a breeder of designer ball pythons—one-of-a-kind, captive-bred snakes whose skin features colors and patterns not usually found in nature. “I think of myself as an explorer,” he told me. Nicking an egg with a pair of surgical scissors, he exposed a live hatchling in its goo. “Even when they haven’t yet touched air, you can sometimes see the tongue going,” he said, making a flicking gesture with his thumb and fingertip. We were standing in a six-thousand-square-foot climate-controlled outbuilding that housed some two thousand pythons, which were kept in individual plastic trays slotted into tall metal racks. The space, which cost nearly a million dollars to build and outfit, was immaculate and well lit, with corner-mounted industrial fans and glossy floors. A vague odor of musk and Clorox was all that hinted at the daily chores of snake husbandry. Ball pythons originated in Africa, and in the wild they are typically dark brown with tan patches and a pale underbelly. Those bred for their appearance, as Kobylka’s have been, often have a brighter palette, from soft washes of pastel to candy-colored bursts of near-fluorescence. Their patterns, too, have been transformed: a snake might be tricked out with pointillist dots, or a single dramatic stripe, or colors dissolving into one another, as in tie-dye. One captive-bred ball python’s splotches and squiggles show up only under a black light. These changes reflect genetic mutations, which breeders call morphs. (The term is also used as shorthand for the snakes themselves.) World of Ball Pythons, a repository of information related to breeding, has catalogued more than seven thousand morphs in the past thirty years—though the actual number likely exceeds that by several thousand. “Evolution can go very fast,” the animal-domestication expert and paleobiologist Marcelo Sánchez-Villagra, a professor at the University of Zurich, told me, adding that the variety of “ball pythons may be extreme even among reptiles.” Arguably, no other snake, lizard, or turtle has been so sweepingly restyled by human effort. The animals Kobylka breeds at Kinova are sold to collectors, independent pet stores, and élite breeders who want to replicate, or even improve on, their design. The launch of a new morph is sometimes called a “reveal” or a “drop,” echoing the language of luxury-sneaker culture, and there are ball-python Internet forums that roil with opinion about which morphs are the hottest, and which ones aren’t worth the hype. The most coveted morphs have commanded higher prices than giraffes, lions, and tigers have at auction. “I’ve had offers of over a hundred thousand dollars on a snake,” Kobylka said. “But the way I operate, it’s important to keep those snakes for my future work. You actually lose money long-term if you sell the most amazing thing at the time.” Kobylka, who is six feet two, was wearing a gray Lacoste polo, charcoal-colored jeans, and Adidas Sambas; he has dark hair, which he keeps short. In the first clutch, which had nine eggs, he was aiming, he said, for an “orange dream, yellow belly, enchi, leopard, desert ghost, carrying axanthic and clown genes.” What sounded like an incantation was a catalogue of desirable mutations. (“Clown,” for example, is named for teardrop shapes that show up under the eyes, like the stylized tears of a clown.) As a breeder, Kobylka always has a “goal snake” in mind. “You’ve done a lot of mental work to imagine it, usually years in advance,” he told me, describing a process of zeroing in on specific traits using the known heritability and interaction of genes. “Sometimes your odds are one in two hundred and fifty-six, or one in five hundred and twelve, to make the snake you’re thinking about,” he said. “The thing that makes it so addicting for me is the fact that there’s a large amount of chance involved.” Kobylka has been breeding snakes for more than twenty years and is known as a trendsetter in the field, which is both close-knit and competitive. Courtney Capps, a co-founder of Leviathan Snakes, in South Carolina, observed that buyers are sometimes so proud of owning a Kinova python that, when it comes time to sell its offspring, they’ll note in the listing, “Mom was produced by Justin.” Kobylka gained an even wider audience in 2016, after he opened up an egg to find a white snake patterned with three orange smiley faces along its body. He had been trying to produce a “dreamsicle”—a white ball python with splotches of tangerine—but most of the circular markings on this snake had two eyes and a grin. Kobylka posted an image on his company’s Facebook page, and, when someone suggested in a comment that the photograph had been edited, he made a fifteen-second video that showed him turning the baby python from side to side to display its distinctive motif. The video of the “emoji python” went viral, and the story of the unusual snake was covered by Esquire, Business Insider, and the New York Post, among other outlets. On the day I visited Kinova, Kobylka wasn’t filming the proceedings, but he sometimes shares egg-cutting videos on Patreon and YouTube. Ball pythons are able to hatch on their own, but such videos, in which a breeder gives a preview of a snakelet’s coloration, have garnered a dedicated following. Offering anticipation, disclosure, and irregular reward, they are, in many ways, similar to toy-unboxing sequences. The footage also has elements of the #oddlysatisfying content known as A.S.M.R. (autonomous sensory meridian response)—videos of human hands gently manipulating something slimy or soft, for instance, or holding an object ready to burst. It isn’t just egg cutting; the entire business of ball-python breeding is extremely online. Breeders deliver pro tips via live stream, develop colorways that will “pop” on Instagram, and often use language borrowed from digital-image editing, promising that a mutation will provide “amazing contrast” or “pixelated sides.” Ball-python aficionados can’t seem to get enough, finding in morphs a combination of clickbait, dream collectibles, data-driven hobby, and living art. Recently, a video of a ball python with the mottling of an overripe banana next to an actual banana was posted widely on X, while a TikTok video showing a ball python named Gizmo tracing a serpentine line on a tablet computer, as if on an Etch A Sketch, has been viewed approximately five million times. (“He tried to draw himself,” one commenter noted.) It was balmy in the outbuilding. Kobylka modulates the temperature to stagger the pythons’ breeding cycles throughout the year (wild females become fertile in response to seasonal cues), but his snakes still seem to intuit the weather outside. A rainstorm can spark mating—Kobylka said that he will sometimes rush to match receptive females to males ahead of a downpour. The first clutch, I learned, had a parent with a pastel gene, which, in addition to being commonplace, causes the animal’s coloring to fade over time. (The standard life span of a captive ball python is fifteen to thirty years, though the St. Louis Zoo had one that keepers believe lived to be at least sixty-two.) Pastel unfortunately dominated the brood: most of the snakes would be priced in the low thousands. But, Kobylka said, “every miss is, as probably a gambler would tell you, almost as exciting as a win.” A miss, he explained, will still find a home, and can provide useful information about how traits are masked, or about other polygenic effects. Link copied Things went better with the next clutch. Glistening in the first shell was a tiny ball python with three recessive traits—“desert ghost, g-stripe, clown”—and another mutation called “spotnose.” The baby snake was the color of straw, with smoky markings down its body, as though it had been repeatedly pinched by hot tongs. “That’s everything it could be,” Summer Melville, Kinova’s business manager, said. The hatchling, a male, would retail for fifteen thousand dollars and be posted on MorphMarket, an e-commerce site for reptiles. “My wife says I didn’t get as excited about our kids being born as when the eggs hatch,” Kobylka told me, “but I knew what to expect with our children.” (The Kobylkas have five children: two adopted, three biological.) “Actually,” he added, “our last son came out with red hair and blue eyes, so he was a double recessive.” As Kobylka went around pulling out trays to show me some of his most valuable full-grown pythons, I was reminded that in nature these creatures are ambush predators. Charles Darwin believed that a fear of snakes is, to some degree, hardwired in us. In “The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals” (1872), he recounts putting his face up against the glass enclosure of an adder in an attempt to conquer “the imagination of a danger which had never been experienced.” The adder struck at the barrier. Darwin couldn’t help but leap backward. But ball pythons are not venomous, and were named for their tendency to curl up when threatened. The ones I saw tended to huddle in a corner, or contract slowly toward the farthest edge of their trays, which were lined with shredded coconut husk. They couldn’t hide their extraordinary appearance, though. I saw a sixty-thousand-dollar python of such stark elegance—bone white and ink—that you could imagine it being unveiled at the Venice Biennale, and a bubble-gum-pink python fit for Barbie. Kobylka admitted to getting quite attached to some of them. Star stickers had been placed on several racks to indicate his favorites, encouraging particular devotion from his staff. In the wild, ball pythons are nocturnal and live mostly underground, often in burrows taken over from rodent prey. They are not very social, though infants may stick together for a short time after hatching. Was Kobylka’s affection, then, one-sided? “Ball pythons don’t seem to mind being held, but they don’t seem as curious as some other species,” he said. The team at Kinova would soon box up dozens of the company’s finest specimens and drive them to Tinley Park, Illinois, for the North American Reptile Breeders Conference (N.A.R.B.C.), one of the most anticipated reptile expos in the nation (“the Mecca of the ball-python market,” as one breeder called it). Kobylka, who owns several Porsches, including a 2016 Cayman GT4 Clubsport that he races, compared the N.A.R.B.C. to a premium car show, offering a window onto the future of the industry. A draw for attendees this year would be the opportunity to meet Emily Roberts, the star of Snake Discovery, a YouTube channel with more than three million subscribers. Kobylka himself was teasing the existence of a baby “sunset combo” on YouTube. “We finally hit something really epic,” he announces in the video. Before leaving Kinova, I asked if I could hold a ball python. Kobylka selected a small lemon-yellow snake and placed its rolled-up body on my open palm. I had expected something cool to the touch, but the snake was warm, the temperature of its enclosure. When I shut my eyes, the impression of it on my hand seemed remarkably faint. “They tend to just sit still, and they’re handleable,” Kobylka said. “They’re just so packaged.” The ball python is known to zoologists as Python regius, or “royal python.” Cleopatra is rumored to have worn one as a bracelet, but the story is almost certainly apocryphal—ball pythons have never been native to Egypt. Today, ball pythons live in western Africa and parts of central and eastern Africa, from Senegal to the borderlands of South Sudan and Uganda. About three feet long, they can be found on the margins of rain forests and in the woods, but they have also adapted to managed environments: timber plantations, agricultural fields, trash heaps. Snakes have evolved without major transformation for more than a hundred million years. Ball-python breeding and collecting is a relatively recent phenomenon. The high end of the American reptile market was long monopolized by large, heavy-bodied snakes, like boas and reticulated pythons. In the early twentieth century, dealers mainly sold their wares to film studios and zoos. By the mid-nineteen-sixties, improved habitat construction in zoos led to snowballing competition for hard-to-collect species—Angolan pythons plucked from war zones along the Namibia-Angola border, iridescent Boelen’s pythons caught on the mountainsides of Papua New Guinea. The consumer market for pet reptiles was sluggish by comparison; through the nineteen-eighties, wildlife traders viewed parrots as more profitable. The investigative journalist Bryan Christy has described reptiles as having been “the Bic lighters of the pet industry: cheap, disposable point-of-sale pets.” Link copied In the early nineteen-nineties, though, household reptiles began to get a reputational makeover. Children raised on “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Jurassic Park” reimagined scaly pets as characterful and intriguing. Retailers started to see an uptick in iguana sales. New Caledonian crested geckos, believed extinct until 1994 and jeopardized today by wildfires and invasive predators, became well established in captivity. Snakes were pitched to prospective buyers as perfect for cramped urban residences: undemanding, hypoallergenic, and needing to be fed only once a week. Ball pythons—which were abundant in their natural habitats and, being compact and docile, highly transportable—were soon arriving in the U.S. by the crateful, tucked into sacks and pillowcases. Between 1989 and 1999, exports of ball pythons from West Africa to the United States tripled. In “The Ultimate Ball Python,” an encyclopedic volume on morphs helmed by the breeder Kevin McCurley, one early broker described them as a “junk” species. In pet stores across the U.S., imported brown-and-tan ball pythons sold for around thirty dollars, discounted for being less alluring than other tropical reptiles. They were quintessential starter pets, and when he was in his mid-twenties McCurley, now an exuberant figure in the snake world, owned two: Eek and Meek. Speaking to me from what he called a “venomous room” in his breeding complex in New Hampshire, McCurley said that one day he had a vision of what ball pythons could be: “I looked at the vehicle of the ball python, and I said, ‘This is the ideal snake. But it needs a totally different paint job.’ ” In 1989, an Oklahoma-based breeder named Bob Clark received a tip about a single albino ball python found in Africa. “I got a letter from a friend in The Hague, Netherlands, about a dealer in Ghana, who had the animal,” he told me. For a few years, Clark had been successfully cultivating albino Burmese pythons, costly novelties that can reach almost twenty feet, which he raised on rats, rabbits, and piglets. But in the ball python’s small size he saw an opportunity. On the strength of a photograph sent to him in the mail, he bought the albino for seven thousand dollars, a price that he said “seemed a little crazy” at the time. It took Clark several years of linebreeding—mating snakes to their forebears, littermates, or descendants—to produce a second albino ball python, and more followed. (Such ball pythons aren’t pure white: you might get a snake with carrot-orange daubs or pale-yellow streaks.) He began selling the hatchlings at seventy-five hundred dollars apiece, and a wait list quickly formed. Collectors liked them, but his main type of client, he found, was the aspiring breeder. “Everybody wants nice, beautiful, expensive snakes that are rare,” he said. “One way they justify that to themselves, and their spouse, is to say, ‘This could be a moneymaker.’ ” Then, in 1994, Clark’s facilities were burgled. The thief got away with his founding albino male as well as females that were heterozygous for the trait. Clark retained a large enough colony to continue, but he began hearing rumors of other albino ball pythons: his supply was no longer exclusive. (The thief was eventually caught and ordered to pay a civil judgment of $2.5 million.) Soon another ball-python type, the piebald, or pied, which features mottled brown spots on an ivory body and is considered scarce in the wild, became popular: in 1997, a pied ball python could sell for thirty thousand dollars. McCurley, who had been breeding reptiles while working a day job as an electronic technician, couldn’t afford an albino, let alone a pied. Instead, he started buying imports with minor irregularities, and mating them to determine whether a specific quirk could be passed on (a process known to breeders as “proving out”). Most anomalies were discreet—a bit of speckling, a squiggle along a spine. Matthew Lerer, who used to sort reptile shipments in South Florida, noted in “The Ultimate Ball Python” that McCurley would study the snakes’ markings for hours, “like he was a gemologist inspecting the Hope Diamond.” Mike Wilbanks, a snake breeder from Oklahoma, told me, of the years that followed, “Some of the morphs turned into gold mines. Some turned out to be just a dry, empty hole.” It is not possible to trademark a morph, but breeders came to view the particular designs they were working toward as commercially sensitive information. The first to produce a morph, and name it, gained celebrity. Many breeders believe that ball pythons’ history of living primarily belowground has preserved an array of mutations related to appearance. The thinking is that eye-catching snakes living aboveground are more visible to predators, making them more liable to be picked off before their genes get passed on. (Ball pythons have poor color vision, and their markings, unlike those of many lizard species, are not thought to play a role in courtship.) By the early two-thousands, middlemen in Ghana, Togo, and Benin had learned that American buyers were willing to spend top dollar for “odd balls”—snakes that diverged from the wild type in even minor ways. What had been an amateur pursuit was fast becoming an industry. Ball-python exports from West Africa peaked at around two hundred and fifty thousand a year in 2005, and began to decline, as domestic breeding replaced mass importation. American captive-bred ball pythons seemed to better express buyers’ notion of the exotic. The wild type had begun to be seen, in McCurley’s words, as “garden variety.” Perhaps not unrelatedly, snakes—and snakeskin—were having a moment in the broader culture as emblems of opulence and transgression. At the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, Britney Spears sashayed across the stage with a seven-foot-long Burmese python slung around her shoulders. Gleaming in the windows of high-end fashion boutiques were python-skin footwear and clothes, often dyed traffic-light green, neon yellow, or electric blue, from Yves Saint Laurent, Jimmy Choo, and Chanel. (“Eve’s Revenge, the Python’s Sorrow,” one headline in the Times ran.) Ball pythons were too small to be profitable for the skin trade, but the Zeitgeist’s embrace of surreally hued scales conferred an aura of glamour on collecting and breeding them. Kobylka had an itinerant childhood. His mother—who raised him and his younger brother on her own—sold handicrafts and moved the family to Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado, Tennessee, and Arizona. Wherever he was, Kobylka spent hours outside. “I always felt there’s a world within a spot,” he said. “Lizards and turtles and frogs, centipedes and salamanders—creatures most people would walk right past and never see.” His mother encouraged Kobylka’s pursuits but insisted that no animal be brought home. “That was the rule with my family: what’s wild is wild.” When Kobylka was a teen-ager, he began attending a small religious boarding school in Oklahoma, where he became fascinated by scarlet king snakes, an elusive, tricolored species. After class, he would go searching for them, turning over logs and debris. He didn’t find one, but he did catch a rattlesnake, which he kept in a homemade cage in his dorm room until he himself was caught. “I met my wife at the school, and it was her mom who called and tattled on me,” Kobylka said with a laugh. The school did offer him an empty room to accommodate the rest of his collection, which by then included White’s tree frogs, box turtles, and a red-tailed boa he had bought at a pet store. At nineteen, Kobylka spent a gap year in Benin, where ball pythons pocket the landscape. While there, he visited a Vodun temple and saw ball pythons, which are regarded as sacred, roaming freely. “I have pictures of me from that time, holding ball pythons, having no concept of: this is going to be my whole life,” he said. What captivated him then were chameleons—reptiles that change color for camouflage or to indicate excitation, rivalry, or submission. He gave local children pocket change for any that they could catch, and placed the animals on the boughs of a tree outside his lodgings. He would sometimes climb the tree and be surrounded by the creatures, the shade tick-ticking with eyes. Kobylka attended Southern Adventist University, in Tennessee, where he majored in communications and began keeping king snakes—which are banded and slender—caged in his dorm bathroom; he soon had fourteen of them. He was reintroduced to ball pythons through the Web site of a Maryland-based breeder named Ralph Davis, who kept pieds. “He had this rock-star personality,” Kobylka told me. “Ralph’s site was the only place you could see all these mutations and get a picture of what was possible. Everyone else was stuck in the Stone Age.” On weekends, Kobylka would visit his uncle, a physician in Georgia. “I was just talking about snakes constantly,” Kobylka said. “I drove him crazy.” One day, his uncle offered to invest in a pair of pastel ball pythons, then top-tier morphs, and to split the profits if they produced salable offspring. They earned enough on the deal that Kobylka was able to persuade his uncle to buy a pied, which he went to fetch from a dealer in Florida. “I still remember driving home with that animal,” Kobylka told me. “I would stop by the side of the road to look at it every hour. And I just—” He exhaled, seemingly at a loss for words. “Amazement,” he said after a beat. (These days, ball pythons are sent between dealers and collectors using overnight mail carriers such as FedEx.) His uncle attached one condition to the purchase: the snake was too valuable to be left in Kobylka’s care, so it would live in a tank next to his uncle’s bed. The early two-thousands were a good time to get into the business. McCurley had received a six-figure bid for three golden snakelets with webbing patterns, called “spider” morphs. The breeder Mike Wilbanks sold a “black-eyed Lucy”—a leucistic ball python—to a Belgian collector for two hundred thousand dollars. People were taking on debt to finance their ball-python purchases. “I had second mortgages on my house so I could have a hundred thousand dollars ready to go if that next new thing came out,” Wilbanks told me. “It was a big race.” Like a new gadget, a morph might be faddish and expensive at first, but as it was sold widely its value would slide to an entry-level price point. Those rare ball-python traits first discovered in the wild and now known as base morphs had followed this trajectory. “They all became accessible,” Kobylka said. He recalled thinking, “Wait a minute, there’s infinite possibilities if we just stack genes together.” He told me, “That’s where I got my jump on the industry.” In 2003, he launched his business, aiming for “combos,” mutations layered together, in order to produce singular dazzlers that could appeal to connoisseur breeders in the U.S. and internationally rather than to big-box pet stores. It would be a slow-release undertaking. “I wanted to imagine a morph combo in the future, and create it ten years later—that was what I was all about,” he said. These days, Kinova’s yield is around fifteen hundred pythons a year, and Kobylka is seen as unrivalled in his artistry with genetic mutations, a breeder at the frontiers of the form. “You will never ever be able to catch Justin Kobylka,” Antoine Hood, of High Desert Pythons, in North Carolina, told me. “How can I parallel him? That’s a better endeavor.” Brittney Gobble, who breeds ball pythons in Tennessee, called Kobylka “a savant.” “He’s able to create a 3-D model, combining five or six mutations in his mind. And then eventually it gets made, and it looks like how he described it,” Gobble said. “It’s truly just insane.” On a brisk October day, I went to the North American Reptile Breeders Conference in Tinley Park, where venders from around the country had set up booths. With most transactions taking place online, expos are seen as an opportunity to launch what Kobylka called “really cutting-edge things.” Many breeders showed their ball pythons in clear acrylic boxes on logo-printed paper; photographs of them would be automatically branded. Kobylka had walked around the venue before it opened to the public, taking note of the competition, but now he couldn’t get more than a few steps away from the Kinova booth without being accosted by neophyte breeders and reptile enthusiasts. In the melee, I saw a buyer lightly rap the top of one of Kinova’s display cases and announce, “That’s the snake—that’s the showstopper.” It was the “sunset combo” morph, which had the bittersweet-orange sheen of heirloom glassware. Kobylka held court, fielding queries and dispensing advice. “Justin would take this off my hands in a second, if I let him,” a breeder who had brought a morph called “Cyborg” said. Emily Roberts’s fans had dressed in pink, and together they formed a shuffling, spangled queue. A woman in a sleek blazer was deftly handling a lustrous slate-blue snake, changing her grip the way a rappeller belays a top rope, hand over hand, as the snake cascaded without progress in the direction of the floor. “They can have quite a spicy temperament,” she declared. “They’re not for beginners.” At the booth for Best Dressed Balls—an Iowa-based venture run by a breeder named Troy Schroeder—a girl of nine patted the box in front of her, fixated on the creature inside. “Tell everyone he’s unlovable, Troy,” she pleaded, hoping to save up enough to bring it home. An estimated six million households in the U.S. include at least one reptile. Millennials make up the largest group of reptile owners, but snakes, lizards, and turtles have become increasingly popular with Generation Z. “One of our concerns is that technology will take kids away from this world,” a breeder observed. “Why would a kid today want to peer at a snake through glass, when they can put a V.R. headset on and play with dinosaurs?” As much as the ball python seems to have been pulled into the technological infrastructure of the twenty-first century—featured in live streams, traded via MorphMarket—snake ownership was frequently portrayed at the expo as an antidote to the anomie of feeling ourselves to be part of a big machine. A 2015 poll of readers by Scientific American Mind found that snake owners were more likely than other pet owners to describe their animals as “part of the family.” Some reptile owners clearly felt that more was more. Bob Clark was in the crowd, buzzing from the recent sale of five “retics” (reticulated pythons) to a customer in the Middle East, for half a million dollars. These snakes were so big that, once crated, a forklift had been needed to move them. Among breeders, the matter of snake size could be divisive. “One per cent of snake keepers are up to taking care of a snake that large, and not the other ninety-nine,” Kobylka said. He expressed unease at the rise of social-media accounts that sensationalize living with gigantic snakes, misrepresenting snake keeping as an extreme sport rather than a serious responsibility. But the majority of collectors were there for the ball pythons. Although Python regius is not endangered in Africa, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (I.U.C.N.) has designated it as near-threatened, and the N.A.R.B.C. prohibits animals that aren’t captive-bred or “quality farm-raised” in the U.S. As I wandered through aisle upon aisle of ball pythons, I wondered if the line between the wild type and the captive-bred could be so easily demarcated. Rob Rausch, who is in charge of juvenile animals at Kinova, told me that he thought ball-python morphs took the pressure off wild-snake populations by satisfying people’s longing for exotic-looking reptiles. “You can go to the wild, and you can get a normal ball python. Or you can come here, and”—he made an openhanded gesture, as of a shopkeeper displaying his wares—“What color do you like? What pattern do you like?” At the N.A.R.B.C., combos that were darker in tone reigned. I saw rows of axanthics, which are monochrome, in ash white, pewter, and black. There was a “hurricane” combo, with lightning slashes of electric yellow along its chocolate-brown sides. Then there were the ball pythons that hadn’t yet been conjured. Kobylka told me that he was hoping to make “a truly zebra-looking animal, with black and white stripes.” He added, “We visualize that, but the difficulty is that’d be a quadruple recessive. That’s many years out.” I had already seen, at the expo, designer “leopard” morphs, with the coloration of a spotted big cat, and there were also two much talked-about “gorilla” combos, which were dark with tortoise-shell ripples: as on fashion runways, there was a constant conflation of wildness with luxury. Ball pythons have come to be seen as unnatural, hothouse creatures. At the conference, I frequently heard them described as “pet rocks”—that is to say, inert and highly collectible. “A snake is a snake,” Clark said. “You can’t make a dog out of it.” I appreciated the fact that many breeders seemed to resist anthropomorphizing their stock. But speaking of ball pythons as “pet rocks” seemed to ignore their fundamental creatureliness. “I’ve had people who have had five-thousand-dollar, ten-thousand-dollar snakes, who said they didn’t want to pay seventy-five dollars for an exam or treatment for that animal,” Mark Mitchell, a professor of zoological medicine in Louisiana, said. “People are much more apt to want to take care of an animal they view affectionately than those they consider commodities.” Yet evolving into eye candy for humans has meant that designer ball pythons, when viewed at the species level, enjoy some of the evolutionary advantages of domestic animals, including wide dispersal. “There isn’t a single endangered species of domestic animal,” Marcelo Sánchez-Villagra told me. “Many have worldwide distribution.” With natural habitats disappearing all the time, finding a way to shelter within anthropic culture might be a good strategy. “What is a better ticket to survival than being beautiful and rare?” Clark said. “Those traits are going to be multiplied in future generations because that’s what people like, not because that’s what kept you from getting eaten.” The evolutionary trade-offs borne by individual snakes in captivity, however, have, in some instances, been dire. Breeders once championed their field as a salve against the cruelties of shipping wild-foraged snakes, which can be at risk for dehydration, parasites, and increased disease transmission, but morphs aren’t always better off. Over time, breeders have discovered that several sought-after traits and specific gene-crossings also produce physical irregularities. Duckbill, in which a snake’s rostrum is upturned and flattened, is a benign deformity, but it is said that some morphs, such as the “caramel albino,” have a higher chance of producing young with spine kinks, a condition that can prevent them from moving sinuously, or can fatally obstruct digestion. “If we hatch a python with small eyes, we won’t sell it as a breeder,” Courtney Capps told me. “We sell those as pets only, because I don’t want the genetics to be passed on. Potentially, at some point, small eyes turn into no eyes.” Another condition that can be distressing is “wobblehead,” a tic that likely betrays neurological issues. Online, breeders have counselled against pairing morphs that are known to result in impairments. (“We want mutations that are just skin-deep,” Kobylka told me. “We don’t want the animal to be at all changed in any way that would hurt its ability to survive.”) But some unusual malformations, unrelated to breeding morphs, can be profitable windfalls: early in the new year, Clark sold a two-headed ball python for a hundred thousand dollars. “Both heads eat,” he assured me, when I inquired after its health. At Kinova, I had asked Kobylka which was the rarest snake in the room, expecting to be shown something supremely expensive. As it turned out, though, the rarest snake was an endling, the last of its kind, and wouldn’t be sold. He retrieved it from a tray. The morph was called “desert,” a snake the color of burnt butter with a toothlike pattern. It was a variety that “everybody loved when it first came out,” he said, “but, if you try to breed them, the eggs will get stuck and they’ll die.” Unsurprisingly, many snake experts are skeptical of the whole morph-making enterprise. “It’s ‘The Island of Doctor Moreau,’ ” the British herpetologist Neil D’Cruze told me. D’Cruze is the head of research at World Animal Protection International, and the senior co-author of “Snakes and Ladders,” a scientific paper on the ball-python trade, published in 2020. “The speed-breeding, the genetic manipulation, it’s being pushed out of the desire to create a new product. Not to help the snake cope better in captivity—to be a better pet for whoever owns it. Are these animals part of a genuine conservation program to help save the species? No.” Some are concerned about the limits of our ability to envision what snakes need, and to act in their best interests. Eben Kirksey, an Oxford professor of anthropology who has written about python-breeding communities in the U.S., believes that seeing “past the dollar value of a snake with particularly colorful skin” would mean offering more to the snakes than racking trays. Breeders “talk about burrowing,” Kirksey said, “but the enclosures I’ve seen, they’re not like actual burrows. These are life-support technologies that people are cobbling together out of plastic, out of machines.” Were the snakes O.K. with all of this? “There are a lot of animals that, unfortunately for them, tolerate captivity well,” D’Cruze told me. “But suffering isn’t always overt. Suffering can be under the hood, invisible.” I had read that it was possible to gauge a python’s stress by measuring its blood cortisol, but as I walked around the expo I found myself troubled by the question of what thriving or discomfort looked like in a snake. Could a python raised in a tray, fed, kept warm and watered, and bred be said to live a full life? In the meantime, the business of breeding rolls ever forward. When ball pythons were first becoming investment pieces, inevitably there were scams. One individual purported to have the world’s first entirely red ball python, and sold the python’s offspring—which were all black—to several U.S. concerns. As clutches laid by those snakes failed to contain any crimson hatchlings, vexed breeders agreed that they’d been conned. New technology promises to change all of that. A topic of fervent conversation at the expo was shed-testing, a kind of 23andMe for snakes, as Kobylka put it. “That’s where our industry is headed,” he said. The testing, which requires the tiniest scrap of molted snakeskin, offers designers a more rigorous way to verify traits. Brittney Gobble told me she had heard that artificial insemination might soon be available for ball pythons, which would expand the field exponentially. I imagined a world where creating new morphs would be a matter of transporting little vials of snake sperm, not the snakes themselves. In one of our earliest conversations, Kobylka had said that he wanted “to make something that is genuinely beautiful to an average person. That’s my criteria—if the person on the street, who doesn’t like snakes, stops and says, like, ‘Whoa, that’s a snake?! I didn’t know a snake could look like that.’ ” But it was also possible to go too far. A scaleless morph, for example, has bald, matte skin, similar to a sphynx cat or a furless guinea pig. Many will recognize it as “the pinnacle of ‘unnatural,’ ” the veterinarian H. Kitt Hollister wrote in “The Ultimate Ball Python,” because it is “delicate, and seemingly unable to survive without human intervention.” The breeder responsible for the morph, Brian Barczyk, who died earlier this year, of pancreatic cancer, marketed it as “smooth and soft,” a completely different texture to touch. Kobylka told me that when he finally got to hold one he was perturbed. The scaleless snake seemed to break the boundaries of what a snake is. “They feel like human skin,” he said, shuddering at the memory. ♦ A reporter’s relationship with Kurt Cobain, before and after the singer’s death.

            To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories Find anything you save across the site in your account By Rebecca Giggs On a fall day in Gainesville, Georgia, Justin Kobylka, the forty-two-year-old owner of Kinova Reptiles, was preparing to cut open two clutches of snake eggs. He was hoping to hit upon some valuable, beautiful reptiles. Kobylka is a breeder of designer ball pythons—one-of-a-kind, captive-bred snakes whose skin features colors and patterns not usually found in nature. “I think of myself as an explorer,” he told me. Nicking an egg with a pair of surgical scissors, he exposed a live hatchling in its goo. “Even when they haven’t yet touched air, you can sometimes see the tongue going,” he said, making a flicking gesture with his thumb and fingertip. We were standing in a six-thousand-square-foot climate-controlled outbuilding that housed some two thousand pythons, which were kept in individual plastic trays slotted into tall metal racks. The space, which cost nearly a million dollars to build and outfit, was immaculate and well lit, with corner-mounted industrial fans and glossy floors. A vague odor of musk and Clorox was all that hinted at the daily chores of snake husbandry. Ball pythons originated in Africa, and in the wild they are typically dark brown with tan patches and a pale underbelly. Those bred for their appearance, as Kobylka’s have been, often have a brighter palette, from soft washes of pastel to candy-colored bursts of near-fluorescence. Their patterns, too, have been transformed: a snake might be tricked out with pointillist dots, or a single dramatic stripe, or colors dissolving into one another, as in tie-dye. One captive-bred ball python’s splotches and squiggles show up only under a black light. These changes reflect genetic mutations, which breeders call morphs. (The term is also used as shorthand for the snakes themselves.) World of Ball Pythons, a repository of information related to breeding, has catalogued more than seven thousand morphs in the past thirty years—though the actual number likely exceeds that by several thousand. “Evolution can go very fast,” the animal-domestication expert and paleobiologist Marcelo Sánchez-Villagra, a professor at the University of Zurich, told me, adding that the variety of “ball pythons may be extreme even among reptiles.” Arguably, no other snake, lizard, or turtle has been so sweepingly restyled by human effort. The animals Kobylka breeds at Kinova are sold to collectors, independent pet stores, and élite breeders who want to replicate, or even improve on, their design. The launch of a new morph is sometimes called a “reveal” or a “drop,” echoing the language of luxury-sneaker culture, and there are ball-python Internet forums that roil with opinion about which morphs are the hottest, and which ones aren’t worth the hype. The most coveted morphs have commanded higher prices than giraffes, lions, and tigers have at auction. “I’ve had offers of over a hundred thousand dollars on a snake,” Kobylka said. “But the way I operate, it’s important to keep those snakes for my future work. You actually lose money long-term if you sell the most amazing thing at the time.” Kobylka, who is six feet two, was wearing a gray Lacoste polo, charcoal-colored jeans, and Adidas Sambas; he has dark hair, which he keeps short. In the first clutch, which had nine eggs, he was aiming, he said, for an “orange dream, yellow belly, enchi, leopard, desert ghost, carrying axanthic and clown genes.” What sounded like an incantation was a catalogue of desirable mutations. (“Clown,” for example, is named for teardrop shapes that show up under the eyes, like the stylized tears of a clown.) As a breeder, Kobylka always has a “goal snake” in mind. “You’ve done a lot of mental work to imagine it, usually years in advance,” he told me, describing a process of zeroing in on specific traits using the known heritability and interaction of genes. “Sometimes your odds are one in two hundred and fifty-six, or one in five hundred and twelve, to make the snake you’re thinking about,” he said. “The thing that makes it so addicting for me is the fact that there’s a large amount of chance involved.” Kobylka has been breeding snakes for more than twenty years and is known as a trendsetter in the field, which is both close-knit and competitive. Courtney Capps, a co-founder of Leviathan Snakes, in South Carolina, observed that buyers are sometimes so proud of owning a Kinova python that, when it comes time to sell its offspring, they’ll note in the listing, “Mom was produced by Justin.” Kobylka gained an even wider audience in 2016, after he opened up an egg to find a white snake patterned with three orange smiley faces along its body. He had been trying to produce a “dreamsicle”—a white ball python with splotches of tangerine—but most of the circular markings on this snake had two eyes and a grin. Kobylka posted an image on his company’s Facebook page, and, when someone suggested in a comment that the photograph had been edited, he made a fifteen-second video that showed him turning the baby python from side to side to display its distinctive motif. The video of the “emoji python” went viral, and the story of the unusual snake was covered by Esquire, Business Insider, and the New York Post, among other outlets. On the day I visited Kinova, Kobylka wasn’t filming the proceedings, but he sometimes shares egg-cutting videos on Patreon and YouTube. Ball pythons are able to hatch on their own, but such videos, in which a breeder gives a preview of a snakelet’s coloration, have garnered a dedicated following. Offering anticipation, disclosure, and irregular reward, they are, in many ways, similar to toy-unboxing sequences. The footage also has elements of the #oddlysatisfying content known as A.S.M.R. (autonomous sensory meridian response)—videos of human hands gently manipulating something slimy or soft, for instance, or holding an object ready to burst. It isn’t just egg cutting; the entire business of ball-python breeding is extremely online. Breeders deliver pro tips via live stream, develop colorways that will “pop” on Instagram, and often use language borrowed from digital-image editing, promising that a mutation will provide “amazing contrast” or “pixelated sides.” Ball-python aficionados can’t seem to get enough, finding in morphs a combination of clickbait, dream collectibles, data-driven hobby, and living art. Recently, a video of a ball python with the mottling of an overripe banana next to an actual banana was posted widely on X, while a TikTok video showing a ball python named Gizmo tracing a serpentine line on a tablet computer, as if on an Etch A Sketch, has been viewed approximately five million times. (“He tried to draw himself,” one commenter noted.) It was balmy in the outbuilding. Kobylka modulates the temperature to stagger the pythons’ breeding cycles throughout the year (wild females become fertile in response to seasonal cues), but his snakes still seem to intuit the weather outside. A rainstorm can spark mating—Kobylka said that he will sometimes rush to match receptive females to males ahead of a downpour. The first clutch, I learned, had a parent with a pastel gene, which, in addition to being commonplace, causes the animal’s coloring to fade over time. (The standard life span of a captive ball python is fifteen to thirty years, though the St. Louis Zoo had one that keepers believe lived to be at least sixty-two.) Pastel unfortunately dominated the brood: most of the snakes would be priced in the low thousands. But, Kobylka said, “every miss is, as probably a gambler would tell you, almost as exciting as a win.” A miss, he explained, will still find a home, and can provide useful information about how traits are masked, or about other polygenic effects. Link copied Things went better with the next clutch. Glistening in the first shell was a tiny ball python with three recessive traits—“desert ghost, g-stripe, clown”—and another mutation called “spotnose.” The baby snake was the color of straw, with smoky markings down its body, as though it had been repeatedly pinched by hot tongs. “That’s everything it could be,” Summer Melville, Kinova’s business manager, said. The hatchling, a male, would retail for fifteen thousand dollars and be posted on MorphMarket, an e-commerce site for reptiles. “My wife says I didn’t get as excited about our kids being born as when the eggs hatch,” Kobylka told me, “but I knew what to expect with our children.” (The Kobylkas have five children: two adopted, three biological.) “Actually,” he added, “our last son came out with red hair and blue eyes, so he was a double recessive.” As Kobylka went around pulling out trays to show me some of his most valuable full-grown pythons, I was reminded that in nature these creatures are ambush predators. Charles Darwin believed that a fear of snakes is, to some degree, hardwired in us. In “The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals” (1872), he recounts putting his face up against the glass enclosure of an adder in an attempt to conquer “the imagination of a danger which had never been experienced.” The adder struck at the barrier. Darwin couldn’t help but leap backward. But ball pythons are not venomous, and were named for their tendency to curl up when threatened. The ones I saw tended to huddle in a corner, or contract slowly toward the farthest edge of their trays, which were lined with shredded coconut husk. They couldn’t hide their extraordinary appearance, though. I saw a sixty-thousand-dollar python of such stark elegance—bone white and ink—that you could imagine it being unveiled at the Venice Biennale, and a bubble-gum-pink python fit for Barbie. Kobylka admitted to getting quite attached to some of them. Star stickers had been placed on several racks to indicate his favorites, encouraging particular devotion from his staff. In the wild, ball pythons are nocturnal and live mostly underground, often in burrows taken over from rodent prey. They are not very social, though infants may stick together for a short time after hatching. Was Kobylka’s affection, then, one-sided? “Ball pythons don’t seem to mind being held, but they don’t seem as curious as some other species,” he said. The team at Kinova would soon box up dozens of the company’s finest specimens and drive them to Tinley Park, Illinois, for the North American Reptile Breeders Conference (N.A.R.B.C.), one of the most anticipated reptile expos in the nation (“the Mecca of the ball-python market,” as one breeder called it). Kobylka, who owns several Porsches, including a 2016 Cayman GT4 Clubsport that he races, compared the N.A.R.B.C. to a premium car show, offering a window onto the future of the industry. A draw for attendees this year would be the opportunity to meet Emily Roberts, the star of Snake Discovery, a YouTube channel with more than three million subscribers. Kobylka himself was teasing the existence of a baby “sunset combo” on YouTube. “We finally hit something really epic,” he announces in the video. Before leaving Kinova, I asked if I could hold a ball python. Kobylka selected a small lemon-yellow snake and placed its rolled-up body on my open palm. I had expected something cool to the touch, but the snake was warm, the temperature of its enclosure. When I shut my eyes, the impression of it on my hand seemed remarkably faint. “They tend to just sit still, and they’re handleable,” Kobylka said. “They’re just so packaged.” The ball python is known to zoologists as Python regius, or “royal python.” Cleopatra is rumored to have worn one as a bracelet, but the story is almost certainly apocryphal—ball pythons have never been native to Egypt. Today, ball pythons live in western Africa and parts of central and eastern Africa, from Senegal to the borderlands of South Sudan and Uganda. About three feet long, they can be found on the margins of rain forests and in the woods, but they have also adapted to managed environments: timber plantations, agricultural fields, trash heaps. Snakes have evolved without major transformation for more than a hundred million years. Ball-python breeding and collecting is a relatively recent phenomenon. The high end of the American reptile market was long monopolized by large, heavy-bodied snakes, like boas and reticulated pythons. In the early twentieth century, dealers mainly sold their wares to film studios and zoos. By the mid-nineteen-sixties, improved habitat construction in zoos led to snowballing competition for hard-to-collect species—Angolan pythons plucked from war zones along the Namibia-Angola border, iridescent Boelen’s pythons caught on the mountainsides of Papua New Guinea. The consumer market for pet reptiles was sluggish by comparison; through the nineteen-eighties, wildlife traders viewed parrots as more profitable. The investigative journalist Bryan Christy has described reptiles as having been “the Bic lighters of the pet industry: cheap, disposable point-of-sale pets.” Link copied In the early nineteen-nineties, though, household reptiles began to get a reputational makeover. Children raised on “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Jurassic Park” reimagined scaly pets as characterful and intriguing. Retailers started to see an uptick in iguana sales. New Caledonian crested geckos, believed extinct until 1994 and jeopardized today by wildfires and invasive predators, became well established in captivity. Snakes were pitched to prospective buyers as perfect for cramped urban residences: undemanding, hypoallergenic, and needing to be fed only once a week. Ball pythons—which were abundant in their natural habitats and, being compact and docile, highly transportable—were soon arriving in the U.S. by the crateful, tucked into sacks and pillowcases. Between 1989 and 1999, exports of ball pythons from West Africa to the United States tripled. In “The Ultimate Ball Python,” an encyclopedic volume on morphs helmed by the breeder Kevin McCurley, one early broker described them as a “junk” species. In pet stores across the U.S., imported brown-and-tan ball pythons sold for around thirty dollars, discounted for being less alluring than other tropical reptiles. They were quintessential starter pets, and when he was in his mid-twenties McCurley, now an exuberant figure in the snake world, owned two: Eek and Meek. Speaking to me from what he called a “venomous room” in his breeding complex in New Hampshire, McCurley said that one day he had a vision of what ball pythons could be: “I looked at the vehicle of the ball python, and I said, ‘This is the ideal snake. But it needs a totally different paint job.’ ” In 1989, an Oklahoma-based breeder named Bob Clark received a tip about a single albino ball python found in Africa. “I got a letter from a friend in The Hague, Netherlands, about a dealer in Ghana, who had the animal,” he told me. For a few years, Clark had been successfully cultivating albino Burmese pythons, costly novelties that can reach almost twenty feet, which he raised on rats, rabbits, and piglets. But in the ball python’s small size he saw an opportunity. On the strength of a photograph sent to him in the mail, he bought the albino for seven thousand dollars, a price that he said “seemed a little crazy” at the time. It took Clark several years of linebreeding—mating snakes to their forebears, littermates, or descendants—to produce a second albino ball python, and more followed. (Such ball pythons aren’t pure white: you might get a snake with carrot-orange daubs or pale-yellow streaks.) He began selling the hatchlings at seventy-five hundred dollars apiece, and a wait list quickly formed. Collectors liked them, but his main type of client, he found, was the aspiring breeder. “Everybody wants nice, beautiful, expensive snakes that are rare,” he said. “One way they justify that to themselves, and their spouse, is to say, ‘This could be a moneymaker.’ ” Then, in 1994, Clark’s facilities were burgled. The thief got away with his founding albino male as well as females that were heterozygous for the trait. Clark retained a large enough colony to continue, but he began hearing rumors of other albino ball pythons: his supply was no longer exclusive. (The thief was eventually caught and ordered to pay a civil judgment of $2.5 million.) Soon another ball-python type, the piebald, or pied, which features mottled brown spots on an ivory body and is considered scarce in the wild, became popular: in 1997, a pied ball python could sell for thirty thousand dollars. McCurley, who had been breeding reptiles while working a day job as an electronic technician, couldn’t afford an albino, let alone a pied. Instead, he started buying imports with minor irregularities, and mating them to determine whether a specific quirk could be passed on (a process known to breeders as “proving out”). Most anomalies were discreet—a bit of speckling, a squiggle along a spine. Matthew Lerer, who used to sort reptile shipments in South Florida, noted in “The Ultimate Ball Python” that McCurley would study the snakes’ markings for hours, “like he was a gemologist inspecting the Hope Diamond.” Mike Wilbanks, a snake breeder from Oklahoma, told me, of the years that followed, “Some of the morphs turned into gold mines. Some turned out to be just a dry, empty hole.” It is not possible to trademark a morph, but breeders came to view the particular designs they were working toward as commercially sensitive information. The first to produce a morph, and name it, gained celebrity. Many breeders believe that ball pythons’ history of living primarily belowground has preserved an array of mutations related to appearance. The thinking is that eye-catching snakes living aboveground are more visible to predators, making them more liable to be picked off before their genes get passed on. (Ball pythons have poor color vision, and their markings, unlike those of many lizard species, are not thought to play a role in courtship.) By the early two-thousands, middlemen in Ghana, Togo, and Benin had learned that American buyers were willing to spend top dollar for “odd balls”—snakes that diverged from the wild type in even minor ways. What had been an amateur pursuit was fast becoming an industry. Ball-python exports from West Africa peaked at around two hundred and fifty thousand a year in 2005, and began to decline, as domestic breeding replaced mass importation. American captive-bred ball pythons seemed to better express buyers’ notion of the exotic. The wild type had begun to be seen, in McCurley’s words, as “garden variety.” Perhaps not unrelatedly, snakes—and snakeskin—were having a moment in the broader culture as emblems of opulence and transgression. At the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, Britney Spears sashayed across the stage with a seven-foot-long Burmese python slung around her shoulders. Gleaming in the windows of high-end fashion boutiques were python-skin footwear and clothes, often dyed traffic-light green, neon yellow, or electric blue, from Yves Saint Laurent, Jimmy Choo, and Chanel. (“Eve’s Revenge, the Python’s Sorrow,” one headline in the Times ran.) Ball pythons were too small to be profitable for the skin trade, but the Zeitgeist’s embrace of surreally hued scales conferred an aura of glamour on collecting and breeding them. Kobylka had an itinerant childhood. His mother—who raised him and his younger brother on her own—sold handicrafts and moved the family to Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado, Tennessee, and Arizona. Wherever he was, Kobylka spent hours outside. “I always felt there’s a world within a spot,” he said. “Lizards and turtles and frogs, centipedes and salamanders—creatures most people would walk right past and never see.” His mother encouraged Kobylka’s pursuits but insisted that no animal be brought home. “That was the rule with my family: what’s wild is wild.” When Kobylka was a teen-ager, he began attending a small religious boarding school in Oklahoma, where he became fascinated by scarlet king snakes, an elusive, tricolored species. After class, he would go searching for them, turning over logs and debris. He didn’t find one, but he did catch a rattlesnake, which he kept in a homemade cage in his dorm room until he himself was caught. “I met my wife at the school, and it was her mom who called and tattled on me,” Kobylka said with a laugh. The school did offer him an empty room to accommodate the rest of his collection, which by then included White’s tree frogs, box turtles, and a red-tailed boa he had bought at a pet store. At nineteen, Kobylka spent a gap year in Benin, where ball pythons pocket the landscape. While there, he visited a Vodun temple and saw ball pythons, which are regarded as sacred, roaming freely. “I have pictures of me from that time, holding ball pythons, having no concept of: this is going to be my whole life,” he said. What captivated him then were chameleons—reptiles that change color for camouflage or to indicate excitation, rivalry, or submission. He gave local children pocket change for any that they could catch, and placed the animals on the boughs of a tree outside his lodgings. He would sometimes climb the tree and be surrounded by the creatures, the shade tick-ticking with eyes. Kobylka attended Southern Adventist University, in Tennessee, where he majored in communications and began keeping king snakes—which are banded and slender—caged in his dorm bathroom; he soon had fourteen of them. He was reintroduced to ball pythons through the Web site of a Maryland-based breeder named Ralph Davis, who kept pieds. “He had this rock-star personality,” Kobylka told me. “Ralph’s site was the only place you could see all these mutations and get a picture of what was possible. Everyone else was stuck in the Stone Age.” On weekends, Kobylka would visit his uncle, a physician in Georgia. “I was just talking about snakes constantly,” Kobylka said. “I drove him crazy.” One day, his uncle offered to invest in a pair of pastel ball pythons, then top-tier morphs, and to split the profits if they produced salable offspring. They earned enough on the deal that Kobylka was able to persuade his uncle to buy a pied, which he went to fetch from a dealer in Florida. “I still remember driving home with that animal,” Kobylka told me. “I would stop by the side of the road to look at it every hour. And I just—” He exhaled, seemingly at a loss for words. “Amazement,” he said after a beat. (These days, ball pythons are sent between dealers and collectors using overnight mail carriers such as FedEx.) His uncle attached one condition to the purchase: the snake was too valuable to be left in Kobylka’s care, so it would live in a tank next to his uncle’s bed. The early two-thousands were a good time to get into the business. McCurley had received a six-figure bid for three golden snakelets with webbing patterns, called “spider” morphs. The breeder Mike Wilbanks sold a “black-eyed Lucy”—a leucistic ball python—to a Belgian collector for two hundred thousand dollars. People were taking on debt to finance their ball-python purchases. “I had second mortgages on my house so I could have a hundred thousand dollars ready to go if that next new thing came out,” Wilbanks told me. “It was a big race.” Like a new gadget, a morph might be faddish and expensive at first, but as it was sold widely its value would slide to an entry-level price point. Those rare ball-python traits first discovered in the wild and now known as base morphs had followed this trajectory. “They all became accessible,” Kobylka said. He recalled thinking, “Wait a minute, there’s infinite possibilities if we just stack genes together.” He told me, “That’s where I got my jump on the industry.” In 2003, he launched his business, aiming for “combos,” mutations layered together, in order to produce singular dazzlers that could appeal to connoisseur breeders in the U.S. and internationally rather than to big-box pet stores. It would be a slow-release undertaking. “I wanted to imagine a morph combo in the future, and create it ten years later—that was what I was all about,” he said. These days, Kinova’s yield is around fifteen hundred pythons a year, and Kobylka is seen as unrivalled in his artistry with genetic mutations, a breeder at the frontiers of the form. “You will never ever be able to catch Justin Kobylka,” Antoine Hood, of High Desert Pythons, in North Carolina, told me. “How can I parallel him? That’s a better endeavor.” Brittney Gobble, who breeds ball pythons in Tennessee, called Kobylka “a savant.” “He’s able to create a 3-D model, combining five or six mutations in his mind. And then eventually it gets made, and it looks like how he described it,” Gobble said. “It’s truly just insane.” On a brisk October day, I went to the North American Reptile Breeders Conference in Tinley Park, where venders from around the country had set up booths. With most transactions taking place online, expos are seen as an opportunity to launch what Kobylka called “really cutting-edge things.” Many breeders showed their ball pythons in clear acrylic boxes on logo-printed paper; photographs of them would be automatically branded. Kobylka had walked around the venue before it opened to the public, taking note of the competition, but now he couldn’t get more than a few steps away from the Kinova booth without being accosted by neophyte breeders and reptile enthusiasts. In the melee, I saw a buyer lightly rap the top of one of Kinova’s display cases and announce, “That’s the snake—that’s the showstopper.” It was the “sunset combo” morph, which had the bittersweet-orange sheen of heirloom glassware. Kobylka held court, fielding queries and dispensing advice. “Justin would take this off my hands in a second, if I let him,” a breeder who had brought a morph called “Cyborg” said. Emily Roberts’s fans had dressed in pink, and together they formed a shuffling, spangled queue. A woman in a sleek blazer was deftly handling a lustrous slate-blue snake, changing her grip the way a rappeller belays a top rope, hand over hand, as the snake cascaded without progress in the direction of the floor. “They can have quite a spicy temperament,” she declared. “They’re not for beginners.” At the booth for Best Dressed Balls—an Iowa-based venture run by a breeder named Troy Schroeder—a girl of nine patted the box in front of her, fixated on the creature inside. “Tell everyone he’s unlovable, Troy,” she pleaded, hoping to save up enough to bring it home. An estimated six million households in the U.S. include at least one reptile. Millennials make up the largest group of reptile owners, but snakes, lizards, and turtles have become increasingly popular with Generation Z. “One of our concerns is that technology will take kids away from this world,” a breeder observed. “Why would a kid today want to peer at a snake through glass, when they can put a V.R. headset on and play with dinosaurs?” As much as the ball python seems to have been pulled into the technological infrastructure of the twenty-first century—featured in live streams, traded via MorphMarket—snake ownership was frequently portrayed at the expo as an antidote to the anomie of feeling ourselves to be part of a big machine. A 2015 poll of readers by Scientific American Mind found that snake owners were more likely than other pet owners to describe their animals as “part of the family.” Some reptile owners clearly felt that more was more. Bob Clark was in the crowd, buzzing from the recent sale of five “retics” (reticulated pythons) to a customer in the Middle East, for half a million dollars. These snakes were so big that, once crated, a forklift had been needed to move them. Among breeders, the matter of snake size could be divisive. “One per cent of snake keepers are up to taking care of a snake that large, and not the other ninety-nine,” Kobylka said. He expressed unease at the rise of social-media accounts that sensationalize living with gigantic snakes, misrepresenting snake keeping as an extreme sport rather than a serious responsibility. But the majority of collectors were there for the ball pythons. Although Python regius is not endangered in Africa, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (I.U.C.N.) has designated it as near-threatened, and the N.A.R.B.C. prohibits animals that aren’t captive-bred or “quality farm-raised” in the U.S. As I wandered through aisle upon aisle of ball pythons, I wondered if the line between the wild type and the captive-bred could be so easily demarcated. Rob Rausch, who is in charge of juvenile animals at Kinova, told me that he thought ball-python morphs took the pressure off wild-snake populations by satisfying people’s longing for exotic-looking reptiles. “You can go to the wild, and you can get a normal ball python. Or you can come here, and”—he made an openhanded gesture, as of a shopkeeper displaying his wares—“What color do you like? What pattern do you like?” At the N.A.R.B.C., combos that were darker in tone reigned. I saw rows of axanthics, which are monochrome, in ash white, pewter, and black. There was a “hurricane” combo, with lightning slashes of electric yellow along its chocolate-brown sides. Then there were the ball pythons that hadn’t yet been conjured. Kobylka told me that he was hoping to make “a truly zebra-looking animal, with black and white stripes.” He added, “We visualize that, but the difficulty is that’d be a quadruple recessive. That’s many years out.” I had already seen, at the expo, designer “leopard” morphs, with the coloration of a spotted big cat, and there were also two much talked-about “gorilla” combos, which were dark with tortoise-shell ripples: as on fashion runways, there was a constant conflation of wildness with luxury. Ball pythons have come to be seen as unnatural, hothouse creatures. At the conference, I frequently heard them described as “pet rocks”—that is to say, inert and highly collectible. “A snake is a snake,” Clark said. “You can’t make a dog out of it.” I appreciated the fact that many breeders seemed to resist anthropomorphizing their stock. But speaking of ball pythons as “pet rocks” seemed to ignore their fundamental creatureliness. “I’ve had people who have had five-thousand-dollar, ten-thousand-dollar snakes, who said they didn’t want to pay seventy-five dollars for an exam or treatment for that animal,” Mark Mitchell, a professor of zoological medicine in Louisiana, said. “People are much more apt to want to take care of an animal they view affectionately than those they consider commodities.” Yet evolving into eye candy for humans has meant that designer ball pythons, when viewed at the species level, enjoy some of the evolutionary advantages of domestic animals, including wide dispersal. “There isn’t a single endangered species of domestic animal,” Marcelo Sánchez-Villagra told me. “Many have worldwide distribution.” With natural habitats disappearing all the time, finding a way to shelter within anthropic culture might be a good strategy. “What is a better ticket to survival than being beautiful and rare?” Clark said. “Those traits are going to be multiplied in future generations because that’s what people like, not because that’s what kept you from getting eaten.” The evolutionary trade-offs borne by individual snakes in captivity, however, have, in some instances, been dire. Breeders once championed their field as a salve against the cruelties of shipping wild-foraged snakes, which can be at risk for dehydration, parasites, and increased disease transmission, but morphs aren’t always better off. Over time, breeders have discovered that several sought-after traits and specific gene-crossings also produce physical irregularities. Duckbill, in which a snake’s rostrum is upturned and flattened, is a benign deformity, but it is said that some morphs, such as the “caramel albino,” have a higher chance of producing young with spine kinks, a condition that can prevent them from moving sinuously, or can fatally obstruct digestion. “If we hatch a python with small eyes, we won’t sell it as a breeder,” Courtney Capps told me. “We sell those as pets only, because I don’t want the genetics to be passed on. Potentially, at some point, small eyes turn into no eyes.” Another condition that can be distressing is “wobblehead,” a tic that likely betrays neurological issues. Online, breeders have counselled against pairing morphs that are known to result in impairments. (“We want mutations that are just skin-deep,” Kobylka told me. “We don’t want the animal to be at all changed in any way that would hurt its ability to survive.”) But some unusual malformations, unrelated to breeding morphs, can be profitable windfalls: early in the new year, Clark sold a two-headed ball python for a hundred thousand dollars. “Both heads eat,” he assured me, when I inquired after its health. At Kinova, I had asked Kobylka which was the rarest snake in the room, expecting to be shown something supremely expensive. As it turned out, though, the rarest snake was an endling, the last of its kind, and wouldn’t be sold. He retrieved it from a tray. The morph was called “desert,” a snake the color of burnt butter with a toothlike pattern. It was a variety that “everybody loved when it first came out,” he said, “but, if you try to breed them, the eggs will get stuck and they’ll die.” Unsurprisingly, many snake experts are skeptical of the whole morph-making enterprise. “It’s ‘The Island of Doctor Moreau,’ ” the British herpetologist Neil D’Cruze told me. D’Cruze is the head of research at World Animal Protection International, and the senior co-author of “Snakes and Ladders,” a scientific paper on the ball-python trade, published in 2020. “The speed-breeding, the genetic manipulation, it’s being pushed out of the desire to create a new product. Not to help the snake cope better in captivity—to be a better pet for whoever owns it. Are these animals part of a genuine conservation program to help save the species? No.” Some are concerned about the limits of our ability to envision what snakes need, and to act in their best interests. Eben Kirksey, an Oxford professor of anthropology who has written about python-breeding communities in the U.S., believes that seeing “past the dollar value of a snake with particularly colorful skin” would mean offering more to the snakes than racking trays. Breeders “talk about burrowing,” Kirksey said, “but the enclosures I’ve seen, they’re not like actual burrows. These are life-support technologies that people are cobbling together out of plastic, out of machines.” Were the snakes O.K. with all of this? “There are a lot of animals that, unfortunately for them, tolerate captivity well,” D’Cruze told me. “But suffering isn’t always overt. Suffering can be under the hood, invisible.” I had read that it was possible to gauge a python’s stress by measuring its blood cortisol, but as I walked around the expo I found myself troubled by the question of what thriving or discomfort looked like in a snake. Could a python raised in a tray, fed, kept warm and watered, and bred be said to live a full life? In the meantime, the business of breeding rolls ever forward. When ball pythons were first becoming investment pieces, inevitably there were scams. One individual purported to have the world’s first entirely red ball python, and sold the python’s offspring—which were all black—to several U.S. concerns. As clutches laid by those snakes failed to contain any crimson hatchlings, vexed breeders agreed that they’d been conned. New technology promises to change all of that. A topic of fervent conversation at the expo was shed-testing, a kind of 23andMe for snakes, as Kobylka put it. “That’s where our industry is headed,” he said. The testing, which requires the tiniest scrap of molted snakeskin, offers designers a more rigorous way to verify traits. Brittney Gobble told me she had heard that artificial insemination might soon be available for ball pythons, which would expand the field exponentially. I imagined a world where creating new morphs would be a matter of transporting little vials of snake sperm, not the snakes themselves. In one of our earliest conversations, Kobylka had said that he wanted “to make something that is genuinely beautiful to an average person. That’s my criteria—if the person on the street, who doesn’t like snakes, stops and says, like, ‘Whoa, that’s a snake?! I didn’t know a snake could look like that.’ ” But it was also possible to go too far. A scaleless morph, for example, has bald, matte skin, similar to a sphynx cat or a furless guinea pig. Many will recognize it as “the pinnacle of ‘unnatural,’ ” the veterinarian H. Kitt Hollister wrote in “The Ultimate Ball Python,” because it is “delicate, and seemingly unable to survive without human intervention.” The breeder responsible for the morph, Brian Barczyk, who died earlier this year, of pancreatic cancer, marketed it as “smooth and soft,” a completely different texture to touch. Kobylka told me that when he finally got to hold one he was perturbed. The scaleless snake seemed to break the boundaries of what a snake is. “They feel like human skin,” he said, shuddering at the memory. ♦ A reporter’s relationship with Kurt Cobain, before and after the singer’s death.

            To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories Find anything you save across the site in your account By Rebecca Giggs On a fall day in Gainesville, Georgia, Justin Kobylka, the forty-two-year-old owner of Kinova Reptiles, was preparing to cut open two clutches of snake eggs. He was hoping to hit upon some valuable, beautiful reptiles. Kobylka is a breeder of designer ball pythons—one-of-a-kind, captive-bred snakes whose skin features colors and patterns not usually found in nature. “I think of myself as an explorer,” he told me. Nicking an egg with a pair of surgical scissors, he exposed a live hatchling in its goo. “Even when they haven’t yet touched air, you can sometimes see the tongue going,” he said, making a flicking gesture with his thumb and fingertip. We were standing in a six-thousand-square-foot climate-controlled outbuilding that housed some two thousand pythons, which were kept in individual plastic trays slotted into tall metal racks. The space, which cost nearly a million dollars to build and outfit, was immaculate and well lit, with corner-mounted industrial fans and glossy floors. A vague odor of musk and Clorox was all that hinted at the daily chores of snake husbandry. Ball pythons originated in Africa, and in the wild they are typically dark brown with tan patches and a pale underbelly. Those bred for their appearance, as Kobylka’s have been, often have a brighter palette, from soft washes of pastel to candy-colored bursts of near-fluorescence. Their patterns, too, have been transformed: a snake might be tricked out with pointillist dots, or a single dramatic stripe, or colors dissolving into one another, as in tie-dye. One captive-bred ball python’s splotches and squiggles show up only under a black light. These changes reflect genetic mutations, which breeders call morphs. (The term is also used as shorthand for the snakes themselves.) World of Ball Pythons, a repository of information related to breeding, has catalogued more than seven thousand morphs in the past thirty years—though the actual number likely exceeds that by several thousand. “Evolution can go very fast,” the animal-domestication expert and paleobiologist Marcelo Sánchez-Villagra, a professor at the University of Zurich, told me, adding that the variety of “ball pythons may be extreme even among reptiles.” Arguably, no other snake, lizard, or turtle has been so sweepingly restyled by human effort. The animals Kobylka breeds at Kinova are sold to collectors, independent pet stores, and élite breeders who want to replicate, or even improve on, their design. The launch of a new morph is sometimes called a “reveal” or a “drop,” echoing the language of luxury-sneaker culture, and there are ball-python Internet forums that roil with opinion about which morphs are the hottest, and which ones aren’t worth the hype. The most coveted morphs have commanded higher prices than giraffes, lions, and tigers have at auction. “I’ve had offers of over a hundred thousand dollars on a snake,” Kobylka said. “But the way I operate, it’s important to keep those snakes for my future work. You actually lose money long-term if you sell the most amazing thing at the time.” Kobylka, who is six feet two, was wearing a gray Lacoste polo, charcoal-colored jeans, and Adidas Sambas; he has dark hair, which he keeps short. In the first clutch, which had nine eggs, he was aiming, he said, for an “orange dream, yellow belly, enchi, leopard, desert ghost, carrying axanthic and clown genes.” What sounded like an incantation was a catalogue of desirable mutations. (“Clown,” for example, is named for teardrop shapes that show up under the eyes, like the stylized tears of a clown.) As a breeder, Kobylka always has a “goal snake” in mind. “You’ve done a lot of mental work to imagine it, usually years in advance,” he told me, describing a process of zeroing in on specific traits using the known heritability and interaction of genes. “Sometimes your odds are one in two hundred and fifty-six, or one in five hundred and twelve, to make the snake you’re thinking about,” he said. “The thing that makes it so addicting for me is the fact that there’s a large amount of chance involved.” Kobylka has been breeding snakes for more than twenty years and is known as a trendsetter in the field, which is both close-knit and competitive. Courtney Capps, a co-founder of Leviathan Snakes, in South Carolina, observed that buyers are sometimes so proud of owning a Kinova python that, when it comes time to sell its offspring, they’ll note in the listing, “Mom was produced by Justin.” Kobylka gained an even wider audience in 2016, after he opened up an egg to find a white snake patterned with three orange smiley faces along its body. He had been trying to produce a “dreamsicle”—a white ball python with splotches of tangerine—but most of the circular markings on this snake had two eyes and a grin. Kobylka posted an image on his company’s Facebook page, and, when someone suggested in a comment that the photograph had been edited, he made a fifteen-second video that showed him turning the baby python from side to side to display its distinctive motif. The video of the “emoji python” went viral, and the story of the unusual snake was covered by Esquire, Business Insider, and the New York Post, among other outlets. On the day I visited Kinova, Kobylka wasn’t filming the proceedings, but he sometimes shares egg-cutting videos on Patreon and YouTube. Ball pythons are able to hatch on their own, but such videos, in which a breeder gives a preview of a snakelet’s coloration, have garnered a dedicated following. Offering anticipation, disclosure, and irregular reward, they are, in many ways, similar to toy-unboxing sequences. The footage also has elements of the #oddlysatisfying content known as A.S.M.R. (autonomous sensory meridian response)—videos of human hands gently manipulating something slimy or soft, for instance, or holding an object ready to burst. It isn’t just egg cutting; the entire business of ball-python breeding is extremely online. Breeders deliver pro tips via live stream, develop colorways that will “pop” on Instagram, and often use language borrowed from digital-image editing, promising that a mutation will provide “amazing contrast” or “pixelated sides.” Ball-python aficionados can’t seem to get enough, finding in morphs a combination of clickbait, dream collectibles, data-driven hobby, and living art. Recently, a video of a ball python with the mottling of an overripe banana next to an actual banana was posted widely on X, while a TikTok video showing a ball python named Gizmo tracing a serpentine line on a tablet computer, as if on an Etch A Sketch, has been viewed approximately five million times. (“He tried to draw himself,” one commenter noted.) It was balmy in the outbuilding. Kobylka modulates the temperature to stagger the pythons’ breeding cycles throughout the year (wild females become fertile in response to seasonal cues), but his snakes still seem to intuit the weather outside. A rainstorm can spark mating—Kobylka said that he will sometimes rush to match receptive females to males ahead of a downpour. The first clutch, I learned, had a parent with a pastel gene, which, in addition to being commonplace, causes the animal’s coloring to fade over time. (The standard life span of a captive ball python is fifteen to thirty years, though the St. Louis Zoo had one that keepers believe lived to be at least sixty-two.) Pastel unfortunately dominated the brood: most of the snakes would be priced in the low thousands. But, Kobylka said, “every miss is, as probably a gambler would tell you, almost as exciting as a win.” A miss, he explained, will still find a home, and can provide useful information about how traits are masked, or about other polygenic effects. Link copied Things went better with the next clutch. Glistening in the first shell was a tiny ball python with three recessive traits—“desert ghost, g-stripe, clown”—and another mutation called “spotnose.” The baby snake was the color of straw, with smoky markings down its body, as though it had been repeatedly pinched by hot tongs. “That’s everything it could be,” Summer Melville, Kinova’s business manager, said. The hatchling, a male, would retail for fifteen thousand dollars and be posted on MorphMarket, an e-commerce site for reptiles. “My wife says I didn’t get as excited about our kids being born as when the eggs hatch,” Kobylka told me, “but I knew what to expect with our children.” (The Kobylkas have five children: two adopted, three biological.) “Actually,” he added, “our last son came out with red hair and blue eyes, so he was a double recessive.” As Kobylka went around pulling out trays to show me some of his most valuable full-grown pythons, I was reminded that in nature these creatures are ambush predators. Charles Darwin believed that a fear of snakes is, to some degree, hardwired in us. In “The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals” (1872), he recounts putting his face up against the glass enclosure of an adder in an attempt to conquer “the imagination of a danger which had never been experienced.” The adder struck at the barrier. Darwin couldn’t help but leap backward. But ball pythons are not venomous, and were named for their tendency to curl up when threatened. The ones I saw tended to huddle in a corner, or contract slowly toward the farthest edge of their trays, which were lined with shredded coconut husk. They couldn’t hide their extraordinary appearance, though. I saw a sixty-thousand-dollar python of such stark elegance—bone white and ink—that you could imagine it being unveiled at the Venice Biennale, and a bubble-gum-pink python fit for Barbie. Kobylka admitted to getting quite attached to some of them. Star stickers had been placed on several racks to indicate his favorites, encouraging particular devotion from his staff. In the wild, ball pythons are nocturnal and live mostly underground, often in burrows taken over from rodent prey. They are not very social, though infants may stick together for a short time after hatching. Was Kobylka’s affection, then, one-sided? “Ball pythons don’t seem to mind being held, but they don’t seem as curious as some other species,” he said. The team at Kinova would soon box up dozens of the company’s finest specimens and drive them to Tinley Park, Illinois, for the North American Reptile Breeders Conference (N.A.R.B.C.), one of the most anticipated reptile expos in the nation (“the Mecca of the ball-python market,” as one breeder called it). Kobylka, who owns several Porsches, including a 2016 Cayman GT4 Clubsport that he races, compared the N.A.R.B.C. to a premium car show, offering a window onto the future of the industry. A draw for attendees this year would be the opportunity to meet Emily Roberts, the star of Snake Discovery, a YouTube channel with more than three million subscribers. Kobylka himself was teasing the existence of a baby “sunset combo” on YouTube. “We finally hit something really epic,” he announces in the video. Before leaving Kinova, I asked if I could hold a ball python. Kobylka selected a small lemon-yellow snake and placed its rolled-up body on my open palm. I had expected something cool to the touch, but the snake was warm, the temperature of its enclosure. When I shut my eyes, the impression of it on my hand seemed remarkably faint. “They tend to just sit still, and they’re handleable,” Kobylka said. “They’re just so packaged.” The ball python is known to zoologists as Python regius, or “royal python.” Cleopatra is rumored to have worn one as a bracelet, but the story is almost certainly apocryphal—ball pythons have never been native to Egypt. Today, ball pythons live in western Africa and parts of central and eastern Africa, from Senegal to the borderlands of South Sudan and Uganda. About three feet long, they can be found on the margins of rain forests and in the woods, but they have also adapted to managed environments: timber plantations, agricultural fields, trash heaps. Snakes have evolved without major transformation for more than a hundred million years. Ball-python breeding and collecting is a relatively recent phenomenon. The high end of the American reptile market was long monopolized by large, heavy-bodied snakes, like boas and reticulated pythons. In the early twentieth century, dealers mainly sold their wares to film studios and zoos. By the mid-nineteen-sixties, improved habitat construction in zoos led to snowballing competition for hard-to-collect species—Angolan pythons plucked from war zones along the Namibia-Angola border, iridescent Boelen’s pythons caught on the mountainsides of Papua New Guinea. The consumer market for pet reptiles was sluggish by comparison; through the nineteen-eighties, wildlife traders viewed parrots as more profitable. The investigative journalist Bryan Christy has described reptiles as having been “the Bic lighters of the pet industry: cheap, disposable point-of-sale pets.” Link copied In the early nineteen-nineties, though, household reptiles began to get a reputational makeover. Children raised on “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Jurassic Park” reimagined scaly pets as characterful and intriguing. Retailers started to see an uptick in iguana sales. New Caledonian crested geckos, believed extinct until 1994 and jeopardized today by wildfires and invasive predators, became well established in captivity. Snakes were pitched to prospective buyers as perfect for cramped urban residences: undemanding, hypoallergenic, and needing to be fed only once a week. Ball pythons—which were abundant in their natural habitats and, being compact and docile, highly transportable—were soon arriving in the U.S. by the crateful, tucked into sacks and pillowcases. Between 1989 and 1999, exports of ball pythons from West Africa to the United States tripled. In “The Ultimate Ball Python,” an encyclopedic volume on morphs helmed by the breeder Kevin McCurley, one early broker described them as a “junk” species. In pet stores across the U.S., imported brown-and-tan ball pythons sold for around thirty dollars, discounted for being less alluring than other tropical reptiles. They were quintessential starter pets, and when he was in his mid-twenties McCurley, now an exuberant figure in the snake world, owned two: Eek and Meek. Speaking to me from what he called a “venomous room” in his breeding complex in New Hampshire, McCurley said that one day he had a vision of what ball pythons could be: “I looked at the vehicle of the ball python, and I said, ‘This is the ideal snake. But it needs a totally different paint job.’ ” In 1989, an Oklahoma-based breeder named Bob Clark received a tip about a single albino ball python found in Africa. “I got a letter from a friend in The Hague, Netherlands, about a dealer in Ghana, who had the animal,” he told me. For a few years, Clark had been successfully cultivating albino Burmese pythons, costly novelties that can reach almost twenty feet, which he raised on rats, rabbits, and piglets. But in the ball python’s small size he saw an opportunity. On the strength of a photograph sent to him in the mail, he bought the albino for seven thousand dollars, a price that he said “seemed a little crazy” at the time. It took Clark several years of linebreeding—mating snakes to their forebears, littermates, or descendants—to produce a second albino ball python, and more followed. (Such ball pythons aren’t pure white: you might get a snake with carrot-orange daubs or pale-yellow streaks.) He began selling the hatchlings at seventy-five hundred dollars apiece, and a wait list quickly formed. Collectors liked them, but his main type of client, he found, was the aspiring breeder. “Everybody wants nice, beautiful, expensive snakes that are rare,” he said. “One way they justify that to themselves, and their spouse, is to say, ‘This could be a moneymaker.’ ” Then, in 1994, Clark’s facilities were burgled. The thief got away with his founding albino male as well as females that were heterozygous for the trait. Clark retained a large enough colony to continue, but he began hearing rumors of other albino ball pythons: his supply was no longer exclusive. (The thief was eventually caught and ordered to pay a civil judgment of $2.5 million.) Soon another ball-python type, the piebald, or pied, which features mottled brown spots on an ivory body and is considered scarce in the wild, became popular: in 1997, a pied ball python could sell for thirty thousand dollars. McCurley, who had been breeding reptiles while working a day job as an electronic technician, couldn’t afford an albino, let alone a pied. Instead, he started buying imports with minor irregularities, and mating them to determine whether a specific quirk could be passed on (a process known to breeders as “proving out”). Most anomalies were discreet—a bit of speckling, a squiggle along a spine. Matthew Lerer, who used to sort reptile shipments in South Florida, noted in “The Ultimate Ball Python” that McCurley would study the snakes’ markings for hours, “like he was a gemologist inspecting the Hope Diamond.” Mike Wilbanks, a snake breeder from Oklahoma, told me, of the years that followed, “Some of the morphs turned into gold mines. Some turned out to be just a dry, empty hole.” It is not possible to trademark a morph, but breeders came to view the particular designs they were working toward as commercially sensitive information. The first to produce a morph, and name it, gained celebrity. Many breeders believe that ball pythons’ history of living primarily belowground has preserved an array of mutations related to appearance. The thinking is that eye-catching snakes living aboveground are more visible to predators, making them more liable to be picked off before their genes get passed on. (Ball pythons have poor color vision, and their markings, unlike those of many lizard species, are not thought to play a role in courtship.) By the early two-thousands, middlemen in Ghana, Togo, and Benin had learned that American buyers were willing to spend top dollar for “odd balls”—snakes that diverged from the wild type in even minor ways. What had been an amateur pursuit was fast becoming an industry. Ball-python exports from West Africa peaked at around two hundred and fifty thousand a year in 2005, and began to decline, as domestic breeding replaced mass importation. American captive-bred ball pythons seemed to better express buyers’ notion of the exotic. The wild type had begun to be seen, in McCurley’s words, as “garden variety.” Perhaps not unrelatedly, snakes—and snakeskin—were having a moment in the broader culture as emblems of opulence and transgression. At the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, Britney Spears sashayed across the stage with a seven-foot-long Burmese python slung around her shoulders. Gleaming in the windows of high-end fashion boutiques were python-skin footwear and clothes, often dyed traffic-light green, neon yellow, or electric blue, from Yves Saint Laurent, Jimmy Choo, and Chanel. (“Eve’s Revenge, the Python’s Sorrow,” one headline in the Times ran.) Ball pythons were too small to be profitable for the skin trade, but the Zeitgeist’s embrace of surreally hued scales conferred an aura of glamour on collecting and breeding them. Kobylka had an itinerant childhood. His mother—who raised him and his younger brother on her own—sold handicrafts and moved the family to Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado, Tennessee, and Arizona. Wherever he was, Kobylka spent hours outside. “I always felt there’s a world within a spot,” he said. “Lizards and turtles and frogs, centipedes and salamanders—creatures most people would walk right past and never see.” His mother encouraged Kobylka’s pursuits but insisted that no animal be brought home. “That was the rule with my family: what’s wild is wild.” When Kobylka was a teen-ager, he began attending a small religious boarding school in Oklahoma, where he became fascinated by scarlet king snakes, an elusive, tricolored species. After class, he would go searching for them, turning over logs and debris. He didn’t find one, but he did catch a rattlesnake, which he kept in a homemade cage in his dorm room until he himself was caught. “I met my wife at the school, and it was her mom who called and tattled on me,” Kobylka said with a laugh. The school did offer him an empty room to accommodate the rest of his collection, which by then included White’s tree frogs, box turtles, and a red-tailed boa he had bought at a pet store. At nineteen, Kobylka spent a gap year in Benin, where ball pythons pocket the landscape. While there, he visited a Vodun temple and saw ball pythons, which are regarded as sacred, roaming freely. “I have pictures of me from that time, holding ball pythons, having no concept of: this is going to be my whole life,” he said. What captivated him then were chameleons—reptiles that change color for camouflage or to indicate excitation, rivalry, or submission. He gave local children pocket change for any that they could catch, and placed the animals on the boughs of a tree outside his lodgings. He would sometimes climb the tree and be surrounded by the creatures, the shade tick-ticking with eyes. Kobylka attended Southern Adventist University, in Tennessee, where he majored in communications and began keeping king snakes—which are banded and slender—caged in his dorm bathroom; he soon had fourteen of them. He was reintroduced to ball pythons through the Web site of a Maryland-based breeder named Ralph Davis, who kept pieds. “He had this rock-star personality,” Kobylka told me. “Ralph’s site was the only place you could see all these mutations and get a picture of what was possible. Everyone else was stuck in the Stone Age.” On weekends, Kobylka would visit his uncle, a physician in Georgia. “I was just talking about snakes constantly,” Kobylka said. “I drove him crazy.” One day, his uncle offered to invest in a pair of pastel ball pythons, then top-tier morphs, and to split the profits if they produced salable offspring. They earned enough on the deal that Kobylka was able to persuade his uncle to buy a pied, which he went to fetch from a dealer in Florida. “I still remember driving home with that animal,” Kobylka told me. “I would stop by the side of the road to look at it every hour. And I just—” He exhaled, seemingly at a loss for words. “Amazement,” he said after a beat. (These days, ball pythons are sent between dealers and collectors using overnight mail carriers such as FedEx.) His uncle attached one condition to the purchase: the snake was too valuable to be left in Kobylka’s care, so it would live in a tank next to his uncle’s bed. The early two-thousands were a good time to get into the business. McCurley had received a six-figure bid for three golden snakelets with webbing patterns, called “spider” morphs. The breeder Mike Wilbanks sold a “black-eyed Lucy”—a leucistic ball python—to a Belgian collector for two hundred thousand dollars. People were taking on debt to finance their ball-python purchases. “I had second mortgages on my house so I could have a hundred thousand dollars ready to go if that next new thing came out,” Wilbanks told me. “It was a big race.” Like a new gadget, a morph might be faddish and expensive at first, but as it was sold widely its value would slide to an entry-level price point. Those rare ball-python traits first discovered in the wild and now known as base morphs had followed this trajectory. “They all became accessible,” Kobylka said. He recalled thinking, “Wait a minute, there’s infinite possibilities if we just stack genes together.” He told me, “That’s where I got my jump on the industry.” In 2003, he launched his business, aiming for “combos,” mutations layered together, in order to produce singular dazzlers that could appeal to connoisseur breeders in the U.S. and internationally rather than to big-box pet stores. It would be a slow-release undertaking. “I wanted to imagine a morph combo in the future, and create it ten years later—that was what I was all about,” he said. These days, Kinova’s yield is around fifteen hundred pythons a year, and Kobylka is seen as unrivalled in his artistry with genetic mutations, a breeder at the frontiers of the form. “You will never ever be able to catch Justin Kobylka,” Antoine Hood, of High Desert Pythons, in North Carolina, told me. “How can I parallel him? That’s a better endeavor.” Brittney Gobble, who breeds ball pythons in Tennessee, called Kobylka “a savant.” “He’s able to create a 3-D model, combining five or six mutations in his mind. And then eventually it gets made, and it looks like how he described it,” Gobble said. “It’s truly just insane.” On a brisk October day, I went to the North American Reptile Breeders Conference in Tinley Park, where venders from around the country had set up booths. With most transactions taking place online, expos are seen as an opportunity to launch what Kobylka called “really cutting-edge things.” Many breeders showed their ball pythons in clear acrylic boxes on logo-printed paper; photographs of them would be automatically branded. Kobylka had walked around the venue before it opened to the public, taking note of the competition, but now he couldn’t get more than a few steps away from the Kinova booth without being accosted by neophyte breeders and reptile enthusiasts. In the melee, I saw a buyer lightly rap the top of one of Kinova’s display cases and announce, “That’s the snake—that’s the showstopper.” It was the “sunset combo” morph, which had the bittersweet-orange sheen of heirloom glassware. Kobylka held court, fielding queries and dispensing advice. “Justin would take this off my hands in a second, if I let him,” a breeder who had brought a morph called “Cyborg” said. Emily Roberts’s fans had dressed in pink, and together they formed a shuffling, spangled queue. A woman in a sleek blazer was deftly handling a lustrous slate-blue snake, changing her grip the way a rappeller belays a top rope, hand over hand, as the snake cascaded without progress in the direction of the floor. “They can have quite a spicy temperament,” she declared. “They’re not for beginners.” At the booth for Best Dressed Balls—an Iowa-based venture run by a breeder named Troy Schroeder—a girl of nine patted the box in front of her, fixated on the creature inside. “Tell everyone he’s unlovable, Troy,” she pleaded, hoping to save up enough to bring it home. An estimated six million households in the U.S. include at least one reptile. Millennials make up the largest group of reptile owners, but snakes, lizards, and turtles have become increasingly popular with Generation Z. “One of our concerns is that technology will take kids away from this world,” a breeder observed. “Why would a kid today want to peer at a snake through glass, when they can put a V.R. headset on and play with dinosaurs?” As much as the ball python seems to have been pulled into the technological infrastructure of the twenty-first century—featured in live streams, traded via MorphMarket—snake ownership was frequently portrayed at the expo as an antidote to the anomie of feeling ourselves to be part of a big machine. A 2015 poll of readers by Scientific American Mind found that snake owners were more likely than other pet owners to describe their animals as “part of the family.” Some reptile owners clearly felt that more was more. Bob Clark was in the crowd, buzzing from the recent sale of five “retics” (reticulated pythons) to a customer in the Middle East, for half a million dollars. These snakes were so big that, once crated, a forklift had been needed to move them. Among breeders, the matter of snake size could be divisive. “One per cent of snake keepers are up to taking care of a snake that large, and not the other ninety-nine,” Kobylka said. He expressed unease at the rise of social-media accounts that sensationalize living with gigantic snakes, misrepresenting snake keeping as an extreme sport rather than a serious responsibility. But the majority of collectors were there for the ball pythons. Although Python regius is not endangered in Africa, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (I.U.C.N.) has designated it as near-threatened, and the N.A.R.B.C. prohibits animals that aren’t captive-bred or “quality farm-raised” in the U.S. As I wandered through aisle upon aisle of ball pythons, I wondered if the line between the wild type and the captive-bred could be so easily demarcated. Rob Rausch, who is in charge of juvenile animals at Kinova, told me that he thought ball-python morphs took the pressure off wild-snake populations by satisfying people’s longing for exotic-looking reptiles. “You can go to the wild, and you can get a normal ball python. Or you can come here, and”—he made an openhanded gesture, as of a shopkeeper displaying his wares—“What color do you like? What pattern do you like?” At the N.A.R.B.C., combos that were darker in tone reigned. I saw rows of axanthics, which are monochrome, in ash white, pewter, and black. There was a “hurricane” combo, with lightning slashes of electric yellow along its chocolate-brown sides. Then there were the ball pythons that hadn’t yet been conjured. Kobylka told me that he was hoping to make “a truly zebra-looking animal, with black and white stripes.” He added, “We visualize that, but the difficulty is that’d be a quadruple recessive. That’s many years out.” I had already seen, at the expo, designer “leopard” morphs, with the coloration of a spotted big cat, and there were also two much talked-about “gorilla” combos, which were dark with tortoise-shell ripples: as on fashion runways, there was a constant conflation of wildness with luxury. Ball pythons have come to be seen as unnatural, hothouse creatures. At the conference, I frequently heard them described as “pet rocks”—that is to say, inert and highly collectible. “A snake is a snake,” Clark said. “You can’t make a dog out of it.” I appreciated the fact that many breeders seemed to resist anthropomorphizing their stock. But speaking of ball pythons as “pet rocks” seemed to ignore their fundamental creatureliness. “I’ve had people who have had five-thousand-dollar, ten-thousand-dollar snakes, who said they didn’t want to pay seventy-five dollars for an exam or treatment for that animal,” Mark Mitchell, a professor of zoological medicine in Louisiana, said. “People are much more apt to want to take care of an animal they view affectionately than those they consider commodities.” Yet evolving into eye candy for humans has meant that designer ball pythons, when viewed at the species level, enjoy some of the evolutionary advantages of domestic animals, including wide dispersal. “There isn’t a single endangered species of domestic animal,” Marcelo Sánchez-Villagra told me. “Many have worldwide distribution.” With natural habitats disappearing all the time, finding a way to shelter within anthropic culture might be a good strategy. “What is a better ticket to survival than being beautiful and rare?” Clark said. “Those traits are going to be multiplied in future generations because that’s what people like, not because that’s what kept you from getting eaten.” The evolutionary trade-offs borne by individual snakes in captivity, however, have, in some instances, been dire. Breeders once championed their field as a salve against the cruelties of shipping wild-foraged snakes, which can be at risk for dehydration, parasites, and increased disease transmission, but morphs aren’t always better off. Over time, breeders have discovered that several sought-after traits and specific gene-crossings also produce physical irregularities. Duckbill, in which a snake’s rostrum is upturned and flattened, is a benign deformity, but it is said that some morphs, such as the “caramel albino,” have a higher chance of producing young with spine kinks, a condition that can prevent them from moving sinuously, or can fatally obstruct digestion. “If we hatch a python with small eyes, we won’t sell it as a breeder,” Courtney Capps told me. “We sell those as pets only, because I don’t want the genetics to be passed on. Potentially, at some point, small eyes turn into no eyes.” Another condition that can be distressing is “wobblehead,” a tic that likely betrays neurological issues. Online, breeders have counselled against pairing morphs that are known to result in impairments. (“We want mutations that are just skin-deep,” Kobylka told me. “We don’t want the animal to be at all changed in any way that would hurt its ability to survive.”) But some unusual malformations, unrelated to breeding morphs, can be profitable windfalls: early in the new year, Clark sold a two-headed ball python for a hundred thousand dollars. “Both heads eat,” he assured me, when I inquired after its health. At Kinova, I had asked Kobylka which was the rarest snake in the room, expecting to be shown something supremely expensive. As it turned out, though, the rarest snake was an endling, the last of its kind, and wouldn’t be sold. He retrieved it from a tray. The morph was called “desert,” a snake the color of burnt butter with a toothlike pattern. It was a variety that “everybody loved when it first came out,” he said, “but, if you try to breed them, the eggs will get stuck and they’ll die.” Unsurprisingly, many snake experts are skeptical of the whole morph-making enterprise. “It’s ‘The Island of Doctor Moreau,’ ” the British herpetologist Neil D’Cruze told me. D’Cruze is the head of research at World Animal Protection International, and the senior co-author of “Snakes and Ladders,” a scientific paper on the ball-python trade, published in 2020. “The speed-breeding, the genetic manipulation, it’s being pushed out of the desire to create a new product. Not to help the snake cope better in captivity—to be a better pet for whoever owns it. Are these animals part of a genuine conservation program to help save the species? No.” Some are concerned about the limits of our ability to envision what snakes need, and to act in their best interests. Eben Kirksey, an Oxford professor of anthropology who has written about python-breeding communities in the U.S., believes that seeing “past the dollar value of a snake with particularly colorful skin” would mean offering more to the snakes than racking trays. Breeders “talk about burrowing,” Kirksey said, “but the enclosures I’ve seen, they’re not like actual burrows. These are life-support technologies that people are cobbling together out of plastic, out of machines.” Were the snakes O.K. with all of this? “There are a lot of animals that, unfortunately for them, tolerate captivity well,” D’Cruze told me. “But suffering isn’t always overt. Suffering can be under the hood, invisible.” I had read that it was possible to gauge a python’s stress by measuring its blood cortisol, but as I walked around the expo I found myself troubled by the question of what thriving or discomfort looked like in a snake. Could a python raised in a tray, fed, kept warm and watered, and bred be said to live a full life? In the meantime, the business of breeding rolls ever forward. When ball pythons were first becoming investment pieces, inevitably there were scams. One individual purported to have the world’s first entirely red ball python, and sold the python’s offspring—which were all black—to several U.S. concerns. As clutches laid by those snakes failed to contain any crimson hatchlings, vexed breeders agreed that they’d been conned. New technology promises to change all of that. A topic of fervent conversation at the expo was shed-testing, a kind of 23andMe for snakes, as Kobylka put it. “That’s where our industry is headed,” he said. The testing, which requires the tiniest scrap of molted snakeskin, offers designers a more rigorous way to verify traits. Brittney Gobble told me she had heard that artificial insemination might soon be available for ball pythons, which would expand the field exponentially. I imagined a world where creating new morphs would be a matter of transporting little vials of snake sperm, not the snakes themselves. In one of our earliest conversations, Kobylka had said that he wanted “to make something that is genuinely beautiful to an average person. That’s my criteria—if the person on the street, who doesn’t like snakes, stops and says, like, ‘Whoa, that’s a snake?! I didn’t know a snake could look like that.’ ” But it was also possible to go too far. A scaleless morph, for example, has bald, matte skin, similar to a sphynx cat or a furless guinea pig. Many will recognize it as “the pinnacle of ‘unnatural,’ ” the veterinarian H. Kitt Hollister wrote in “The Ultimate Ball Python,” because it is “delicate, and seemingly unable to survive without human intervention.” The breeder responsible for the morph, Brian Barczyk, who died earlier this year, of pancreatic cancer, marketed it as “smooth and soft,” a completely different texture to touch. Kobylka told me that when he finally got to hold one he was perturbed. The scaleless snake seemed to break the boundaries of what a snake is. “They feel like human skin,” he said, shuddering at the memory. ♦ A reporter’s relationship with Kurt Cobain, before and after the singer’s death.

            TechBeamers Tutorials for beginners to learn Python, Java, Selenium, C/C++, CSharp, Angular, PHP, JavaScript, Agile, Manual and Automation Testing Feb 23, 2024 by Meenakshi Agarwal 2 Comments Hello dear Python coding buddies. It’s time to get your brain in action and solve some challenging problems. We have worked out 10 Python tricky coding exercises to be done using loops. These would require you to brainstorm, think at multiple levels, and test your coding grit to solve. However, a coding solution is provided for each of these. Write a Python program that checks if a given number is a row number in Pascal’s Triangle. Pascal’s Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, where each number is the sum of the two directly above it. Pascal’s Triangle is like a pyramid of numbers where each number is found by adding the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts and ends with 1, and the interior numbers are the sum of the two numbers above them. It’s a way of organizing numbers that helps with binomial expansions in math. In Pascal’s Triangle, each row contains a sequence of numbers, and these numbers are binomial coefficients. A triangular number, when associated with a row in Pascal’s Triangle, would be one of these binomial coefficients in that row. To clarify, if a number is a triangular number, you should be able to find it in one of the rows of Pascal’s Triangle. It will be one of the numbers in that particular row. That’s what we’ll be doing to identify a number as the row in the triangle. Example: Solution: The above code first checks whether the input number is a triangular number by using this formula (8 * num + 1) ** 0.5. After that, it looks for its row index in the Pascal triangle. We tested the code with multiple inputs and tried to print the results with detail. Moreover, a full triangle is also displayed so that you can cross-check the result visually. Write a Python program that checks if a given 2D list forms a magic square. In a magic square, the sum of numbers in each row, column, and main diagonals is the same. Example: Solution: Write a Python program that generates a spiral of prime numbers. The program should take a positive integer n and output an n x n matrix with prime numbers arranged in a spiral pattern. Example: Solution: These exercises involve intricate patterns and require careful consideration of loop structures and mathematical concepts. They aim to test problem-solving skills and the ability to work with loops effectively. Let’s continue with a few more challenging and tricky Python coding exercises. They will push you to think critically and carefully. Each exercise involves a unique problem that requires creative solutions. You are given a grid with m rows and n columns. Starting from the top-left corner, you can move either down or right at any point in time. Write a Python program to find the number of unique paths to the bottom-right corner. Example: Solution: Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0’s and 1’s, find the largest square containing only 1’s and return its area. Such a matrix is also known as a binary maximal square by definition has the most and same no. of rows and columns with 0’s and 1’s. Example: Solution: A message is encoded into numbers where each digit corresponds to a letter (‘1’ -> ‘A’, ‘2’ -> ‘B’, …, ’26’ -> ‘Z’). Write Python code to find out the total ways to decode a non-empty string of digits. Example: Solution: These exercises tackle a variety of algorithmic challenges, including dynamic programming and matrix manipulation. They encourage critical thinking and careful consideration of edge cases. Let’s continue with a few more tricky and challenging Python exercises. Given a binary tree and a target sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path’s sum equals the target sum. In a binary tree, a “root-to-leaf path” is the sequence of nodes you encounter while traversing from the root of the tree to a leaf node. A leaf node is a node that doesn’t have any children. For example, in the below tree, a root-to-leaf path could be: [1, 2, 4]. Example For the binary tree: and target sum = 22, the paths are: Solution The solution involves depth-first traversal of the binary tree while keeping track of the current path and checking the sum at each leaf node. Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S that contains all the characters of T in complexity O(n). A Minimum Window String refers to the shortest substring of a given string that contains all the characters of another specified string. So, in other words, you should look for a substring in S that has all the characters of T and is as small as possible. The complexity constraint O(n) means that you aim for an efficient linear-time solution. Example Solution The solution requires the sliding window technique and maintaining a frequency map of characters in the strings. Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. In an array, a “Longest Increasing Subsequence” is a sequence where each number is greater than the previous one. They don’t have to be next to each other, just always increasing. Example You have an array of numbers. Find the length of the longest subsequence where the elements are in increasing order. Solution The solution involves dynamic programming to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. These Python coding exercises cover various aspects such as tree traversal, string manipulation, and dynamic programming. Each problem has a specific statement, example, and a brief description of the solution approach. Determine if a 9×9 Sudoku board is valid.

Enriched with more detail and test cases. It is now providing the correct output. Re-checked, other exercises as well, they all are running fine. Soon, will publish all the corresponding scripts on GitHub as well. However, if you still observe any issue, please let me know. Thanks. Héctor R Ramírez says Feb 22, 2024 at 3:59 am Hi, there, hope you’re all having a great time. I’m seriously baffled with the first “trick” in this article; have you tested it with n==3? My point is: It’s hard to tell from the problem statement what is this program doing exactly! By the way, the right answer for n=6 -according to the code published as it is- is False.
