            由尔冬升监制，简君晋导演，姜大卫、余香凝、林保怡领衔主演的电影《白日之下》官宣定档，将于4月12日正式上映。同时曝光的“凝视”版海报以报纸为背景，一双眼睛凝视前方，故事感十足；“真相”版预告则充满悬疑凝重的配乐，院舍内暗藏罪恶，众人奔走寻找真相，隐藏在新闻背后的冷漠和残酷逐渐揭开。 此前，第42届香港电影金像奖公布提名名单，《白日之下》以16项提名领跑，备受业内外人士期待。该片讲述了记者深入调查残疾院舍虐待事件，揭露隐藏在新闻背后、鲜为人知的真相的故事。影片不局限于单纯叙事，而是通过抽丝剥茧的方式让主角带领观众，逐一解开案件背后的谜题，揭露人性深处的黑暗底色。 无家可归的老人在福利院委曲求全以求获得片瓦遮雨，年轻时一意孤行的留守老人在年老后无人照顾，意外丧命的坠楼少年被家人说成是一种解脱……影片刻画生动角色，每个人物都有自己的故事，揭露不同的社会现象。 《白日之下》的剧本参考了多宗真实案件。据悉，导演简君晋在看到报道后被残酷的真相震撼，在与当事新闻调查记者聊天的过程中了解到其内心的挣扎与矛盾。于是，简君晋决定用影像记录正在发生的事情，以记者的故事构思《白日之下》。 文 | 记者 王莉 图 | 出品方提供

            美国中央司令部2月26日发表声明表示，也门萨那时间24日晚，也门胡塞武装发射了一枚反舰导弹，袭击目标可能是也门亚丁湾一艘悬挂美国国旗、由美国所有和运营的燃料及化学品运载货轮“托尔姆·索尔”号。美国中央司令部表示，导弹并未击中油轮而是在水面上爆炸，没有造成人员伤亡或船体损坏。 此外，美国中央司令部还称，也门萨那时间24日晚，美军在红海南部击落2架单向攻击无人机，第3架无人机因故障坠毁。
